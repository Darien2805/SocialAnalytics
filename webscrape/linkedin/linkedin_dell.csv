1,"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place. I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Terence Poh Aaron K. Godwinn W. Rachel Ow Yeong 
    Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.
    Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act. 
    The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.
    Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me. 
    Special Thanks
    Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Eugene Swee and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon. #innovation #cloud #hackathon"
2,"I am proud to announce that my TEAM TAGAR came in 2nd Place in SCDF and Dell’s Innovation Lifesavers’ Innovation Challenge 2022.
    This summer break (1/6/22 – 9/7/22), I took the opportunity to push myself further by attending my first innovation/ hackathon – SCDF and Dell’s Innovation Lifesavers’ Innovation Challenge 2022- together with my TAGAR teammates: Terence Poh Alexander Goh Godwinn Wong Rachel Ow Yeong
    Our project idea aimed to help reduce SCDF Paramedics’ cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network and displaying it with an easy to read and user-friendly UI. Furthermore, we made case-specific Just-in-Time revision easily accessible through our application.
    Having served national service, we understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid special attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. Our solution then aimed to maximise their germane load by improving the processes without placing change on the way they think or operate. 
    Working with cloud computing technologies was a first for me. It was a gruelling task to design and develop a cloud-native minimal viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to VMware’s cloud. I gain valuable knowledge on project management using an Agile Framework as well as crucial developer skills such as Flask, Laravel, and VMware Tanzu Application Service. This hackathon gave me the confidence that I lacked, and I am extremely happy to have participated and given it my all. If given the opportunity, my team and I look forward to furthering the development of the product.
    Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Eugene Swee and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon. Last but not least, the men and women from the 4th SCDF DIV HQ for the valuable sharing sessions.

6,"Today marks the end of my 12-week internship journey as a Worldwide Procurement Intern in Dell Technologies. Recognised as having one of the world's best supply chains, I applied for an internship position here with the intention of learning from world-class industry experts in the supply-chain field. After 3 months here in Dell, I can confidently say that I have left with so much more. 
    For me, the biggest takeaway from Dell is to dig deep and always be curious. When I first stepped into the office, I was immediately introduced to the concept of 1X1s - 1 on 1 meetings with any partner to learn more about their work function or to gain insights on a particular issue. Questions are welcomed, if not highly encouraged, in Dell and despite how busy the managers and mentors were, my questions were always thoughtfully answered. This has helped me gain tons of insights not only in procurement, but in other job functions as well. 
    On top of this, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities all interns were given to showcase and refine our skills. There was never a dull day in the office. From hackathons to projects focused on aiding the team solve real-world issues, we were constantly being challenged to think critically and analytically. Though I admit it got hectic at times, the warm and supportive culture in Dell was of great help through these tough times. 
    Although this 12-week internship was just the tip of the iceberg into the procurement field, my perspective has definitely broadened from the numerous 1X1s, Brown Bags, Executive Speaker Series, networking sessions and department events with the outstanding team here in Dell. 
    I'd like to thank my intern team Jan Ng Linh Phan Wan Xian Quek for being such remarkable group mates to work with and learn from. I am grateful for the team's ""never-say-die"" spirit - supporting each other throughout no matter how tough it got. I'd also like to thank Isabel Yao for sacrificing precious work hours to answer our never-ending set of questions and for being the best buddy any intern could ask for. Also huge thanks to Vivek Sharma for his superb mentorship and perceptive feedback on our projects, Christe Elmenzo for being such a supportive and approachable mentor, Evan Goh for his technical expertise and guidance, Margaux Vatel and core team for an unforgettable internship programme, and all other interns for such a wholesome and vibrant experience. 
    Once again, heartfelt thanks to Dell Technologies for this opportunity. Till next time!"

9,"This past Friday was my last day as a Cookie Governance Intern at Dell Technologies. Every week there was something new to learn on improving the Digital Tracking Inventory site. It was a wonderful experience, especially that it was my second internship with Dell. I felt like I walked into this internship with a lot more confidence and a stronger work ethic.
    By far, the biggest highlight was going to the Dell headquarters at Round Rock, TX for a week. I was able to connect with so many great interns and participate in Dell’s Hackathon. Every moment was memorable and I would love to live it again.

    We created a website for inventory management by scraping the data from the email and updating the data to our inventory table. 
    Due to time constrain we only used basic HTML CSS, jQuery for the front end, and PHP for our backend. After a day of continuous coding, we managed to hit the third place in the hackathon. And the great thing was that my teammates also managed to secure a job placement at Dell. Congrats to my teammates Thinagaar Ganesan, Prasanth Manimaran, Shanmugasundran Ramachandran, and wishing them all good luck on your new journey and a huge thank you to our mentor Mufhim Anees who guided and helped us to develop a better solution for this hackathon."
14,"8 years ago, studying at Zewail City was just a ""dream"" for me. Two weeks ago, I graduated from Zewail City of Science and Technology!
 
    In school, I have always been a top achiever. I got the First Place award in my senior year (Thanaweya Amma) for the highest grade in my school. However, I still doubted whether I could pass the university's admission tests! I decided to give it a try and studied for them, but I wasn't satisfied at all with my performance. I was quite sure that I won't get accepted. But then, I got accepted! (The impostor phenomenon had another opinion though😂)
    
    During my college days, I always believed that my work in the courses, especially projects, isn't good enough. Throughout these 5 years, I tried to make use of every single opportunity to learn and grow. I was NEVER satisfied and that had always pushed me to work even harder! 
    
    In my journey, I KNEW that if I can't understand any concept, there was always someone (a student/ Dr/ TA) here to help, without anything in return!
    
    In my journey, I met the best and smartest people ever. Being surrounded by them has developed my way of thinking. Also, being part of a community from diverse backgrounds with different points of view has made me more flexible and open-minded.
    
    In my journey, I always felt blessed for studying a field that I'm really PASSIONATE about by the most wonderful professors.
    
    In my journey, I unlocked capabilities in myself that I didn’t know existed, either through student activities/ competitions/ group projects.
    
    In my journey, I discovered that I was a perfectionist! I wanted everything to be 100% perfect, and that was the reason why I always doubted myself and was never satisfied with my performance! 
    “Until you realize perfection is an ideal and not a reality, you will never have self-confidence.” ― J.S. Felts
    
    But then,
    I learned that perfectionism is an “illusion”. There is nothing perfect. I was trying to reach something that didn’t exist and doubted myself for not succeeding! Now, I seek “balance”. Balance is the key. I try to produce the best possible outcome within the given time. Efficiency!
    “Be prolific, not perfect.” ―Richie Norton
    “Imperfection facilitates improvement, perfection facilitates stagnation.” ―Abhijit Naskar

    Finally, I graduated with an Excellent degree and a recognition medal for serving the ZC community through winning first place in Dell's hackathon and participating in a student activity (IEEE) as a head of a team in a major event. Also, I got straight A's in all of the courses in my senior year in both semesters (GPA 4.00/4.00), which was one of the hardest years. On top of that, I and my team won first place in CIE Projects Exhibition 2022 for the best graduation project.
    
    Do not seek perfectionism, just focus on “improvement”.

    That was just a glimpse of my journey in Zewail City.
    I believe I'm ready for the next steps!

16,"With my time @ Dell Technologies come to a close in late August, I wanted to take a chance to thank the folks who gave me the opportunity to learn, grow as an engineer and now be given the chance to return next August as a #delltechnologies graduate software engineer.

    Major thanks to my team for the constant support, guidance and creating such a positive environment to work in. Learning new development frameworks, languages and teamwork skills gave me much more insight into what I'll be tackling as part of the graduate program and I cannot wait to reconnect with all of you and have the opportunity to further my learning on a professional level.

    I'd like to thank the organizers of the Dell Hackathon for giving me the space to network with other interns within the organisation, some of whom are fellow grads I can't wait to meet (and hopefully work with) again.

    I'd also like to thank my teammates in the intern core social team and those that attended social events I partook and assisted in organising. Learning more aspects of the business and life perspectives of those whom I spoke with is, I feel, an invaluable part of my learning and wellbeing.

    It was great to be part of an organisation that provided more chances to learn and grow than I had time within those near six months. Here's to having it next year! :) #graduate #iwork4delltechnologies"

    Team MSG is back in action. With the same members, same team but a different Hackathon, we manage to come up the 3rd place 🥉.

    The UIUX Hackathon is something new to us, where we were asked to design and a propose UI UX solution for the current dell.com. After nights of discussion and brainstorming, we came up with the idea of having a UI that implements the minimalistic design with small changes in the web page flow. We also research on the latest UI trend that can be implemented in our design.

    On the presentation day, I am stunned by the other teams with their presentation. Their ideas are innovative and their presentation skills are amazing. Congrats to ZHE SWIEN L., Teoh Su Theng, and their team for winning first place 🥇 and to Jacky Voon, Lau Kah Hou and the rest of team Peanuts for winning second place 🥈.   

    I’ve learned so much throughout the process, including on how to design an aesthetic UI, how UI design is related to human cognitive efforts, and many more. I really like the part where we receive feedbacks from the judges on our presentation. This helps us to acknowledge our weaknesses that can be improved on.

    Thanks to the TIDE Hackathon committee for organizing such an amazing hackathon. Last but not least, once again thank you to my teammates Pang Shian Wei and Guo Xuan Low for the outstanding effort in making this a success.

42,"Last Thursday, I was privileged enough to participate in Dell's Virtual Hack2Hire hackathon as my first real-deal hackathon (develop a prototype in under 24 hours). Co-leading the team alongside Daniel Wan Jonathan was no doubt an eye-opening experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:

    1. Emphasis on each members' expertise is paramount to your team's success. Since this was our first time working on a fast-paced project, a slight lack of expertise in a certain domain/framework can slow down your progress by a considerable degree.

    2. “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” – Benjamin Franklin. The planning phase in software development is crucial when working with a deadline. Even though our team took the initiative to break down the modules to be developed using Trello, we realized certain key aspects were left out eg. the wireframing of our user interface, as too much emphasis was placed on the backend logic of our application.

    3. Communication is key when attempting to convey your ideas to your team members and stakeholders. As future developers, the ability to think clearly determines your ability to relay information. Clear thinking == clear communication.

    Squid CTF is the Capture the Flag (CTF) competition in Dell Technologies, the official Cybersecurity Hackathon of TIDE-Hackathon Pillar. CTFs are a type of competitive hacking event in which the teams participating need to solve tasks or challenges related to different aspects of cybersecurity to get the hidden flags. The team with more points within a shorter time will be the winner.

    The competition received 220 individual registrations from around the globe. 73 teams were formed, 62 teams actively participated. Our team once is the first in round 1 but was overtook by some other experienced group later. After round 2, only the top 10 finalists will be eligible to enter the final round: Attack Defense CTF. Fortunately enough, we barely earned the ticket to the final round as we came in as 10th in round 2.

    I’ve learned so much throughout the decrypting, reverse engineering, decoding, attack and defense process. Big thanks to beloved team member Tan Guang Yi, Thing Wei Jen and Pang Shian Wei for all the efforts throughout this journey.

The categories include web, trivia, forensics, reverse engineering, cryptography and misc. We had lots of fun and manage to get the 10th place after completing round 2, which is the bare minimum requirement to get to round three (only the top 10 teams will advance to round 3).

    The 3rd round is an Attack & Defense style CTF where each team will try to attack other team’s system as well as defending their own system. Round of applause to Wei Jen Thing, Guo Xuan Low and Pang Shian Wei for guiding and helping me in using Linux commands as I’m a beginner in it.

    I reunited with my long-time partner Nur Faidz Hazirah Nor'Azman (under the aptly-named Raidz v2.0 banner) at the last minute to come up with potential design improvements for Dell.com (specifically the Product Compare function) and workable Figma prototype in just a week's time.

    In some ways, this hackathon is more challenging than Hack2Hire due to having to juggle between this and work (can only meet up at night—lasting even past midnight sometimes) as well as the lack of UI/UX design knowledge and experience.

    While we didn't make it to the top 3 (so close to nabbing third), this was a worthwhile experience still and I'm proud of my team for getting this far given it was only the two of us. Among the highlights of our proposal (which was unique for our team) was the introduction of dyslexic-friendly mode to improve accessibility.

    I'm writing this at 2:36 a.m. on March 23, 2022. I'm not sure where to start, but I’d want to share my recent #experience participating in a #hackathon (Dell Virtual Hack2Hire). I'd wanted to participate in a hackathon for a long time, but I didn't have the #courage to do so.

    But, in Feb 2022, I received a call from the Dell team offering me the #opportunity to participate in a hackathon. I took some time to decide and started to approach my friends to team up with me for the hackathon. Unfortunately, most of them are not available at the designated time.

    After thinking, I decided to simply send my name and give it a go. I've been teamed up with my new friends from UTHM. Since this is my first time participating in a hackathon, I am #thrilled to do my very best to #assist my team as much as possible and give exposure to my team members as they are from different backgrounds. It was a big #challenge for us at first, but nothing couldn’t be overcome with the team's excellent #teamwork and #coordination. I’m happy to guide my team and it was definitely a great experience for me. 

    Long story short, the moment we've all been waiting for has arrived: the winner will be announced. Of course, I didn't put high #hope for my team because I realized there were a lot of other teams that performed better throughout the presentation. Surprisingly, towards the end of the session, I saw my name was #shortlisted on the list as a selected applicant, with an immediate employment offer attached. I can't describe how I truly felt, I'm shocked and in denial because it was indeed a dream come true to be accepted into a reputable company like Dell.

    Thank you to my team, my mentor Mr. Faizal Damiri and Mr. Muhammad Nasir for the guidance, Mr. Fauzaman Mat Sari and Ms. Tess for the constructive feedback on the design, Mr. Elmen, the judges, and the Dell Digital Malaysia team. I shall do everything in my ability to fulfill the needs of the company. Insya-Allah.

    But with our biggest strengths i.e. our teamwork, our bond, and our will, to not give up finally made us the winners of SIH'22

    I would like to thank Eshan N. , Upanshu Singhal and KIRAN KALE for all the motivation, appreciation, suggestions and guidance throughout.

    I would also like to pay my gratitude to Presidency University Bangalore for making the whole experience so smooth and memorable with great hospitality and support.

    A special thank you to our mentors Dr Pratima Singh and lucknesh Kumar for their constant guidance and backing.

    And not to forget Harshit Shukla for always being just a call away with the solution to every problem.😇

90,"I've had an incredible 9 weeks as a Digital & Global Business Operations Project Management Intern at Dell Technologies! Here are some of my most impactful memories:

    🎯 Project

    This summer, I worked on Lisa Kessler’s team to help make our in-app digital sales enablement tool robust and accessible before it deploys to sellers more internationally. It was a great opportunity to learn project management skills of understanding stakeholders' needs along with creating and revising project goals. It was also a cool way to put the data analysis and strategic business communications skills I learned in the classroom to use in the workplace.

    🎯 Volunteer

    Outside of my project, I volunteered to give a self-care workshop to teenage girls in halfway houses at the Texas Juvenile Justice Department. Gira Gomez, Stephanie Aniello, Allison Warren, and I presented on the importance of mental health, strategies for self-care, the power of our words, and strategies for consistency in self-care. It was an incredible opportunity to give back and educate on a topic that's crucial to all of our lives. It was also inspiring to get to know and lead with such powerhouse women who are passionate about uplifting the community!

    🎯 Hackathon

    During our in-person week in Round Rock, TX, I participated in a 24-hour hackathon with Eric Waters, Josue Guajardo, Mya Thompson, and Jonathan P.. We were tasked with providing a solution for a real-life pain point faced within Dell Digital. As project manager, I helped my team come up with the strategy to automate the process of using skill ratings to match new hires in the ITDP rotational program with managers. I had a great time seeing how my teammates' and I's various skills put together helped us achieve a working solution in under 24 hours.

    🎯 Relationships

    It's been incredible meeting so many people on my team, across different orgs, and in different roles. I can't say thank you enough to everyone who took the time to meet with me, and to everyone who helped me reach success this summer. HUGE thank you to Rachel Gilman, Lisa Kessler, Julie Humble, Courtney Reddington, PMP, Dallas Maddox, Tatiana Barbone, Maggie Becker, Kendall DuLaney, and to all the other phenomenal people I've met and had the pleasure of working with this summer!

April Staines, Lisy Kane, Amanda Watts, Tammy Bryant Butow and I formed Girl Geek Academy to change the ratio of the number of women and girls building the internet.

    Most recently we have partnered with Microsoft's incredible industry leaders championing the inclusion of women and girls: a massive shout out to Elizabeth Fuller, Matt Furse, Erica S. and Muskan N. for helping to bring fun technology and AI skills to Year 7-10 girls in ANZ every Monday and leading our mentoring program. If you know a high school girl or teacher: IT'S FREE! https://lnkd.in/djpr4ct2

    A BIG HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GIRL GEEK ACADEMY! Here's a few memories to celebrate:

    🦄 It all started with #SheHacks, the world's first all women hackathon, in 2014, which has since seen wide support from across the startup sector.

    🦄 We then went on to build programs such as #MissMakesCode teaching girls coding from age 5 supported by the Australian Government and Victorian Government

    🦄 #SheMakesGames and our Games Career Incubator supported by VicScreen, changing the ratio of women in games (currently around 19% in Australia)

    🦄 Our children's book series written by Alex Miles & published by Penguin Random House Australia & New Zealand Holly Toohey have sold over 30,000 copies!

    🦄 The Gender Equality Game Jam supported by Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) & City of Port Phillip as part of Gender Equality through the Arts

    🦄 NAB and Dayle Stevens OAM for creating the Girl Geek in Residence program.

    🦄 The Rethink Pink school holiday programs in partnership with Sunsilk Unilever championed by Eliane Woolley

    🚀 #SheFlies - we look forward to seeing gender equality in the skies alongside our ambassador Catherine B. and would you believe April is making a spacesuit right this very second 👩‍🚀

    To say the past few years has been tough would be a massive understatement (in fact I have COVID right now!). Many things have tried to take us out.

    But we are still here. 🤘

    To be honest, we wouldn't be if it wasn't for all of our partners (schools, governments, leading companies, people working in industry and the young people who join us) who come together to support the vision that we can create a more inclusive internet, built by diverse teams.

    And our team: thank you to Leura Smith, Rubii Red, Cherie Tan and Kate S. who keep the wheels on the bus every day.

    Those who back our vision early and often I will forever be thankful as we celebrate our cake day! 🎂"

    Greeting Connections,
    I am thrilled to announce that my team #SwasthyaVardhak has won the #smartindiahackathon2022 in the grand finale held at Presidency University Bangalore. We worked on the Problem Statement given by Dell Technologies to recognize, understand and digitize the doctor's handwriting. Hence we created a mobile application that digitizes handwritten prescriptions, doctor notes, and lab reports by converting images into machine-readable format via Machine Learning Models.
    It was a vivid experience where we worked hard and sleeplessly for 36+ hours. Our journey had crests and troughs right from the beginning, from being waitlisted in the internal SIH to having two problem statements selected for the Hackathon. We faced many challenges like; hunting datasets, missing documentation of the technologies, and crashing of the online platform, which supported our Machine learning model during the final demonstration. But we endured the grind and implemented solutions and objectives as suggested by the Jury. The teamwork, compassion, and unwavering will made us the Winners.
    My earnest gratitude to my team, which worked together to make this win possible.
    Ayushi Gautam, the member who worked hard as a team player; and had the dynamism to handle any problem in need of the hour.
    Bhavya Agrawal, the composed member with optimistic confidence, made every possible feature in the application with consistent efforts.
    Garima Saroj, the member who brought the whole team together, worked in every aspect to put the work on the table.
    MANISH KUMAR RAI, the member who always boosts morale and works to bring coordination to our efforts.
    Yash Deep, the member who brought all theoretical aspects to life with ease; and had the resolve to deliver work on time.
    I want to thank our evaluators, Upanshu Singhal, Eshan N., and KIRAN KALE, for their motivation, appreciation, suggestions, and guidance throughout the Hackathon, with their captivating enthusiasm, aura, and unparalleled wisdom that made us realize our true potential.
    A special thank you to our mentors, Dr. Pratima Singh, and lucknesh kumar, for their constant guidance and backing.
    It was a memorable journey. I am looking forward to more such experiences.

107,"Can entrepreneurs learn from the next young tech start-up college dropout, billionaire, 30-year-old, Dylan Field, of the proposed Adobe Figma Merger? 

    He joins the elite like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Larry Ellison, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Dell and even John D. Rockefeller who were all college dropouts.

    Presented by Entrepreneur's Network --> eprenz.com

    Dylan Field, the co-founder CEO of San Francisco-based Figma, along with Evan Wallace, is ready to become the world’s next young billionaires.

    While Adobe shares took a major dive the week the merger was announced, the company is committed to acquiring Figma, an innovative collaborative SaaS design tool. COVID shifted workers to remote working, and most have not returned to physical locations, placing a premium on remote collaborative solutions.
    
    While the story of Figma is interesting, the number of college dropout billionaires is an increasing phenomenon. What can entrepreneurs learn from their success?

    1) Intelligence:  These billionaire dropouts appear to be uniquely gifted and intelligent, often attending top universities. Dylan was not only attending Brown University but also Co-Chaired Brown's Computer Science Dept and organized a group of 150 students in a hackathon.

    2) Connected: They connect with other billionaires and tech influencers who help mentor them.

    3) Funded: Often the same billionaires and tech influencers & investors who help mentor them provide early funding. In Dylan’s case, it was Peter Thiel, who invested in him with $100,000 in exchange for a commitment to drop out of college and pursue the start-up.

    4) Scalable tech start-ups: They nearly all have experience and make their billions in tech start-ups. Tech businesses are nearly the definition of scalable meaning once the tech is developed, they can sell almost an infinite number of additional users for little extra expense.

    Does dropping out of college increase your chances of becoming a billionaire? That’s unlikely unless you are also extremely intelligent and gifted, are well connected or able to form those key connections, and are able to develop a unique business in the tech space.
