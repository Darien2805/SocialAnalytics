For anyone trying to get their foot into the software world, I would absolutely recommend the Code For Good Hackathon. I’ve only participated in two hackathons now, but each time I do I feel like my knowledge rockets forward by months. The best way to learn is to do, and there’s no better place to do than a hackathon. For anybody that will soon be participating in one of the other Code For Good Hackathons or wants to participate next year, the best advice I can give is to collaborate! Our team worked closely together from start to finish and that is above and beyond, the reason we were able to win.     Finally, I just want to point out the charitable nature of the event. Often as professionals, we can get too caught up in what company we’re working for and how much money we’re making; and while I certainly won’t pretend that those don’t matter, events like these really shine a light on the good that technology can do for the world. I don’t think anybody wants to get to retirement having done very little good for the world at large. To aspiring software engineers Code For Good, is a great opportunity to learn and do good; and to current software engineers, I would encourage you to think about how you can use your skills to make a real difference.     Thanks to & for setting up an incredible event. Shout out to , , , & for being brilliant mentors. , , , , , and were my teammates, and I’ve gotta say; someone needs to hire them :). These are some of the smartest people I’ve met throughout my time in software development! I really look forward to seeing how JPMorgan uses the solutions we’ve started to make an impact!\",\n",
