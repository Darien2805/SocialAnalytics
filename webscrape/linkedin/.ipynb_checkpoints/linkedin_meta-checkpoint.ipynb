Eventually, the inherent urge to gain experience and learn motivated me to participate in this event. And, I cannot be more proud of myself for taking the decision to persevere day and night for Meta\\'s (Facebook) 1st Global Hackathon. 😍I am very pleased to announce that I achieved an 𝗔𝗹𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝟮, 𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝘀𝗶𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 (𝗔𝗣𝗔𝗖) 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝟰, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝟵 in the Meta Global Hackathon 2022. The hackathon lasted for 14 Days while my university exams were going on. For, every single day we completed the challenges thrown on us by the Meta team. 🧑\\u200d💻Each day, we would receive Daily Coding Challenges testing our skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. I would wake up early in the morning, half asleep, and sit at my study table to complete all the coding challenges for the given day to get extra  points for the fastest submission. A huge thanks to Rubmary Rojas for taking Coding Workshop.⌛ The dreadful Find the Bug Challenge involved finding a bug on the given code in under 2 minutes with the correct code in its place! The question involved DSA in #cpp , #python , #java , and #javascript . From finding secret keys in impenetrable Zip files using Linux Command Line to scoring full on the Quiz, it wouldn’t have been possible without the teachings I got from the Andrei Răduță, Yanping Xie,  Ben Plimmer, Giovana Delfino, Anqi Tu , Jordan Lam, and  Christoph Besel workshops and Lightning talks. 🥽My personal favorite, the Product Thinking Challenge, for which I spent the majority of time along with my teammates, Shoaib Shama and Jayesh Asawa, brainstorming and implementing a solution for making education more effective and accessible for rural communities. The inspiration for our solution came from Dedi Gadot’s Talk after which we used Metaverse to solve the problem students face.🤝🏻In my journey from the 300th rank, all the way to a whopping Global Rank of 1, my constant desire to improve and the support of my Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE), my friends and family were my source of motivation.🎓At last, I would like to thank Nicole Holloway, Joaquin Benavente, Melinda Davenport, and IME ARCHIBONG , and the entire Meta Team for organizing such a great hackathon.

The hackathon lasted for 14 Days while my university exams were going on. For, every single day we completed the challenges thrown on us by the Meta team. 🧑\\u200d💻Each day, we would receive Daily Coding Challenges testing our skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. I would wake up early in the morning, half asleep, and sit at my study table to complete all the coding challenges for the given day to get extra  points for the fastest submission. A huge thanks to Rubmary Rojas for taking Coding Workshop.⌛ The dreadful Find the Bug Challenge involved finding a bug on the given code in under 2 minutes with the correct code in its place! The question involved DSA in #cpp , #python , #java , and #javascript . From finding secret keys in impenetrable Zip files using Linux Command Line to scoring full on the Quiz, it wouldn’t have been possible without the teachings I got from the Andrei Răduță, Yanping Xie,  Ben Plimmer, Giovana Delfino, Anqi Tu , Jordan Lam, and  Christoph Besel workshops and Lightning talks. 🥽My personal favorite, the Product Thinking Challenge, for which I spent the majority of time along with my teammates, Shoaib Shama and Jayesh Asawa, brainstorming and implementing a solution for making education more effective and accessible for rural communities.

This included clearing up some storage space on my laptop (the red bar has been haunting me for a while) as well as gathering evidence as part of my off-the-job training.    20% of my apprenticeship is off-the-job training, which could be university lectures, research, workplace mentoring , shadowing, or workshops!    I have an off-the-job training log where I note these activities and link photo and video evidence to show that I've done them!    While filling that log isn't exactly my favourite activity in my apprenticeship, I know it will help me to identify what I need to work on and in my endpoint assessment!

Counterintuitively, I find hackathon a great tool to fight burnout, for many reasons:  1. unleashing creativity.  2. forcing me to think outside of my day-to-day work  3. empowering me to wear different hats.

Much lower cost than failing my own startup if, say, I kick start an immature idea.  6. bonus: sometimes you might get lucky to pitch to execs.   7. finally and most importantly, it's such fun to work on an idea a whole team is passionate about!

The newest of these is the Metaverse Standards Forum, which aims to drive open interoperability, which could make it easier for developers to build across platforms.    As announced today, the forum already has some major players on board, such as Meta, Microsoft, Epic Games, Adobe, NVIDiA, Sony, Unity and others. But there are also some glaring absences, including companies like Niantic, Apple, Roblox and Snapchat, which are building consumer “metaverse” products as well.    The Metaverse Standards Forum is free to join and plans to focus on “pragmatic, action-based projects” like hackathons and open source tooling.    “There won’t be a Meta-run metaverse, just as there isn’t a ‘Microsoft internet’ or ‘Google internet’ today,” explained Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg in a blog post last month. “Like the internet, the metaverse will be an interconnected system that transcends national borders, so there will need to be a web of public and private standards, norms and rules to allow for it to operate across jurisdictions.”    Consortiums like these are only effective if enough companies adopt their standards, though.    Tiffany Xingyu Wang, chief security officer at AI content moderation company Spectrum Labs, launched the Oasis Consortium earlier this year. In an effort to promote greater commitments to safety from gaming and social companies, the Oasis Consortium developed a list of user safety standards, which it hopes will become an industry standard.    “If the metaverse is going to survive, it has to have safety in it,” Wang told the Technology Review.    Content moderation is especially tricky in virtual reality, when online harassment or abuse can feel even more frightening due to the immersive nature of the technology. And in some cases, it seems like companies are prioritizing product development over robust safety tools.    Similar to the Metaverse Standards Forum, some key players are missing from the Oasis Consortium, like Meta. And in the past, groups like this have become smaller and smaller once internal conflict inevitably arises.    The Metaverse Standards Forum is led by the Khronos Group, a nonprofit consortium working on AR/VR, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more. Khronos has already tried to set a standard for VR APIs with its similarly named VR Standards Initiative in 2016, which included companies like Google, NVIDIA.

       " {'post': 'An amazing global hackathon wrapped up yesterday, by/for the Knowledge Management community in a hybrid brainstorming session. Here are my Top 10 Takeaways!       1. The case for structure: busy professionals are all for ideation sessions, but structured flow and workspaces matter to keep things focused and on-time.  2. The case for messiness: there will be disagreements, differences in perspectives, and tech glitches – but that is part of the ideation journey as well.  3. The case for tools: Zoom and Google Docs are great, and newer platforms like Miro take virtual collaboration to another level. Tools will be key in the hybrid era.  4. Space for humour: jokes, mistakes and gaffes will be there aplenty, enjoy them! By mistake, people may join the wrong room, over-write others’ text, forget to un/mute mikes – laugh it off.  5. The need for leadership: Leaders who take inputs, build consensus, find sponsors, inspire communities, and unblock activities can drive knowledge collaboration.  6. The need for volunteers: The lion’s share of open community work is driven by volunteers, who rise above the occasion and catalyse participation. Worship them!  7. The power of design and design thinking: Understanding journey maps, problem space, ideation space, preto/prototyping, and stakeholder empathy are key for knowledge work.  8. The envelope of creativity: Creativity in the form of innovative designs, quirky mottos, energising games, icebreakers, and metaphorical photographs, can be thought-provoking and inspirational.  9. The in/visible hand: culture. Without a culture of humility, respect, curiosity, excellence, openness, safety, and commitment, knowledge cultures cannot succeed and scale.  10. The joy of discovery: As ideas are posted on sticky notes, clusters arise, ‘meta-knowledge’ emerges, and a new wave of ideas is triggered off – in cumulative spirals.    More lessons and takeaways will be shared in the coming days. For more such excitement and insights, join the today! Hats off to the whole team ...

I am beyond excited and honored to be featured as only 1 individual out of the Reality Labs Global Field Community receive this recognition every month. It\\'s always a great feeling to represent a company where you feel valued and appreciated and where creativity is welcomed.    We were tasked a Field Mission for our Hackathon Field Contest Period 5 for 2 weeks in December to interview Retail Sales Associates and ask them, \"What is your favorite accessory to sell and why?\" After filming my first video with a Best Buy PC Associate. I noticed something was lacking as there wasn\\'t enough spark on the video.    After one sleepless night, I totally remembered my time when I was a Substitute Teacher during 2018-2020. I remembered one day substitute teaching at a Junior High School where the students felt defeated, had no energy, and lacked enthusiasm. I then took inspiration to one of the most charismatic and energetic Game Show Host, with Family Feud. I ordered a Golden Microphone prop on Ebay and conducted Classroom like it was a Game Show and the students were participants. Surprisingly, the effect turned out well as classroom participation and engagement rapidly increased and students were live, animated, and jolly again. I remember leaving class and one of the students thanked me for trying and it feels great to feel appreciated to know I made a difference in someone\\'s life.    Fast forward to now, I then took the same approach and it turned out to be a success once again. I ordered multiple Microphone props but this time customized it with Meta, Oculus, and Ray Ban Stories logo to make it look official using cardboard boxes. The creative microphones added that final touch on conducting interviews/testimonials with my Brand Influencers, Retail Sales Associates at /, and customers at Best Buy/ Pop Up Stores as well as formal trainings at (Ray Ban Stores). Many individuals loved the creativity and outside the box thinking as customer interactions and employee engagements felt more natural, fun, and real. It was such a huge success that there was a spin off and the bar was raised even higher in creativity when I introduced the Meta Boxing Gloves Gen 1 for 2 special interviews.    I’m excited for this new year as I’ll have the opportunity of showcasing more creativity and BIG ideas that allow me to contribute to and the Reality Labs Global Field Community. I am extremely grateful to be part of a great organization and I enjoy taking on assignments and goals that allow me to contribute to this company.',\n",

Before diving into a Developer and Leader path, I started my career as a Software Tester, which provided a strong foundation for the professional I am.    A little bit of background is that I used to do some extra work at a platform named Global App Testing, basically outsourcing my testing skills. Around 2017, already working at IBM and amid the hackathon and meetup fever, I received an invite to participate in an event called Testathon. It was a one-day event, which you can picture as a Hackathon for testers. Long story short: It was awesome and positively impacted my career.     Here we are today after a difficult period for the whole world, and I gladly received an invitation to the third Sao Paulo edition of the same event. I currently lead a squad focused on web solutions within IBM, and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to extend the invite to my peers.    The event's purpose perfectly matched our moment as a squad, as we are looking for ways to improve our testing capabilities. We had a lot of fun at the event; the networking was excellent, and I found some familiar faces. Plus, the food and free swags were great, as usual.    Things were already great considering the event as a whole and the lovely book I got as a gift from my friend Ronald, but the cherry on top was winning the prize for the best quality bug report and seeing my friend Allan bring home one for the best QA team with the folks he met there.    I'm grateful for the moment, and as I said in the beginning, my hopes for the future are the best possible. I'm proud of my team and look forward to our upcoming challenges.\",\n",

We were also told to chat with someone from our local team or across the Global Community and to be creative :) This Hackathon Field Contest which eventually turned into a passion project of mine received outstanding feedback from the Meta Team directly as well as it’s Global Partners. This Creative and Collaborative Project made the Reality Labs Team vision come true when they built the Global Community with other 3rd Party Labor Agencies representing Meta and I just wanted to share it with everyone as I am very proud of this project.    When I first received this project, I immediately thought how can I make this the most impactful and creative way being a Global Team. After brainstorming ideas, I reached out to each Global Partner , , , and asked if they could send me a video asking me, “What are some of my sales best practices?” Then, I wanted to answer that question while highlighting each specific country in an innovative way using the Portal Go. Fortunately, I already visited United Kingdom, France 2x, Spain, and had content/photos that I’m able to utilize for this passion project leaving Japan by itself since I still have not been there yet. Without having been to Japan, I decided to take a trip to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles and immerse myself within the language and environment. Being in the Japanese environment, I was able to learn quickly the basic introduction and greetings in Japanese and even implemented those as well for Team Japan’s segment.    For Team USA’s segment, I kept it simple with Having the 3 C’s which have totally helped me not only in sales, career, and school but also in relationships. To close the video with a bang, I dug in deep with the production value by wearing an international multiple flag jacket unifying all countries involved in the Global Field Team as well as holding the Belt signifying success with a sincere Thank You speech with Meta’s Mission Statement. To end this post, I want to thank all the Global Partners and people that helped me contribute for this video , , , , and making Meta Labs Reality dream and vision come true. Enjoy everyone :)',\n",

Back in the day, girls could hardly mention the name of any lady they would love to emulate should they take a career path in tech in the future. The lack of female role models and mentors in Africa greatly reinforced the perception that careers in tech are generally for men and not women.    women are generally less likely to take a career path in tech and other STEM fields(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) while in school. A study by UNESCO reveals that women constitute 28% of STEM students in sub-Saharan Africa, this is below the global average of 30%, a situation that has for a long time widened the gender gap. Women's participation in STEM subjects drops progressively moving up the education and career ladder.    African women in the tech industry are also subjected to some level of bias in the roles assigned to them. Despite having technical skills and qualifications, women are still pushed towards roles that are perceived to be non-technical, mostly touching on execution while their male counterparts perform technical roles.    Women in tech, especially in Africa are subjected to low hiring rates, less pay and are often overlooked in promotions. Global statistics reveal that 39% of women view gender bias as the primary reason for not being offered a promotion. Equality decreases with the rise in seniority as far as women are concerned. A study by Entello reveals that women account for 19% of tech roles. At the senior level, the percentage drops to 16%, and at the executive level, only 10% of roles in tech are held by women.    Their contribution, efforts and achievements are often overlooked. Despite being the brains behind some of the world's notable technological advancements and achievements, women's contribution is unrecognised on many occasions with men taking credit for some of the success achieved by women.    Recent efforts to empower women in technology seem to bear fruits. compared to the past, there is now increased visibility of female role models in the tech space. Furthermore, there is also increased access to tech career opportunities for women.    The Emergence of all-female boot camps, incubators, accelerators, hackathons and grants in Africa is a “game changer” in the African tech ecosystem. Initiatives such as this have accelerated female inclusivity in the tech space by providing opportunities for women to close the gap that currently exists in the tech space.    Women now also are given senior positions in big tech companies. Recently Microsoft engineering hub in Nairobi appointed Catherine Muraga as a managing director.

Essa iniciativa seguiu o formato de um hackathon online, com a , , , , , , , , e Lucas de Lima. Super projeto de impacto sustentável, com diversas ações previstas para breve, aguarde! Parabéns para todo o time desde já!    Hoje, SUSTENTABILIDADE é um tema crescente, amplo e complexo, envolvendo ÁGUA, ENERGIA, TRATAMENTO DE RESÍDUOS e PESSOAS, em estratégias de ESG - Environmental, Social and corporate Governance.    Até 2019, a saúde planetária já era um desafio, com números crescentes de atenção e cuidado. No pós-pandemia, esses desafios serão ainda maiores, com o aumento de desigualdades e necessidade de atuação mais forte sobre recuperação de rendas, adoção de economia circular, eliminação da pobreza extrema, tendências de reuso, produção sustentável, inclusão social, tratamento de resíduos, ações para a diversidade, impacto ambiental e responsabilidade social. E hoje no Brasil, revivemos desafios conhecidos como seca, crise hídrica, crise energética, aumento de desigualdades.     Em alguns dias, a COP26 (conferência do clima em Glasgow, na Escócia) terá início, de 31 de outubro a 12 de novembro e já é considerada crucial para a revisão de ações e metas para o controle e redução do impacto com as mudanças climáticas. A Terra está ficando mais quente, continuamos com termoelétricas, continuamos queimando derivados de petróleo, usamos pouco matrizes renováveis de energia como eólicas ou solar, oceanos estão mais plásticos, a degradação de biomas é crescente, geleiras derretem, para citar alguns desafios que serão temas para debates.     A dica é acompanhar o que será discutido na COP26 em alguns dias, quais compromissos serão firmados, como cada país irá se posicionar nessa jornada e o impacto para cada um de nós de forma prática, a partir de 2022 e até 2030.         A década que começou com o desafio da pandemia e da saúde da humanidade, deve seguir com o desafio da sustentabilidade e da saúde planetária. Mas a próxima vacina será de conscientização sobre o impacto de nosso modo de vida para o planeta.',\n",

       " {'post': \"Il y a une semaine, j'ai eu l'occasion de participer à mon premier hackathon sur la plateforme Gitcoin.    Gitcoin est une plateforme où des développeurs peuvent être payé pour travailler sur des projets open source en liaison avec Web3. Il est aussi possible de participer à des hackathons avec des entreprises partenaires comme j'ai pu le faire et d'être récompensé en .    L'hackathon lancé par l'entreprise avait pour challenge d'intégrer leur fonctionnalité de login au sein d'une Dapp.    Cet forme de login permet à l'utilisateur de se connecter facilement sur une application sans avoir à renseigner de mot de passe et juste en mettant en lien au final son adresse de portefeuille (pensez sorte de compte bancaire pour crypto monnaies). Mais son utilisation va plus loin en permettant aussi de récupérer des méta-données qui seraient liés à cette adresse, comme une adresse mail ou nom d'utilisateur, ce qui permettrait de ne pas avoir à gérer et collecter ce genre d'information sur sa propre application.    Ayant déjà ma propre Dapp à un stage assez avancé, notamment pour la connexion de portefeuille, j'ai décidé de démarrer un nouveau projet et me suis lancé dans le challenge. Quelques problèmes d'intégration sont arrivés mais globalement l'expérience fut bonne et m'a permis d'en apprendre plus sur un nouveau moyen de connexion qui permet globalement une meilleure expérience utilisateur.  Challenge terminé, 50 participants, dont moi même, ont été récompensé.    Après réflections, j'en viendrais sûrement à intégrer cette fonctionnalité dans ma propre Dapp, une fois que la fonctionnalité et ses dépendances seront arrivés en V1 et seront donc plus stable.\",\n",

I like to call this ability – the second capability of our framework for business ecosystem leadership, on which I take a closer look in this edition of my newsletter.    There are five important questions companies must answer with confidence if they want to master the dual nature of ecosystem strategy:    -  Who are we?  -  Why do we participate?  -  What do we contribute?  -  Are we ready?  -  How do we compete?
