"My friends Tran Linh Chi, SOPHIA MARANI and I participated as Team Jolibeeee in Ninja Van's Code Dojo 22 and spent our Thursday and Friday brainstorming and developing our solution. We developed a Telegram chatbot that could be integrated into Ninjava's existing platform that would help tackle the communication issues between the drivers and the higher chain of command whenever the driver faced sudden disruptions during delivery. Potential iterations could include Voice to text NLP as well as analytics to aid in route planning and parcel delivery optimization.    Even though we did not place in the finals (we were so close), we had a unique and fun experience in Ninjavan. We'd like to thank the organizers involved for filling us up with a constant stream of food, coffee, and energy drinks and the handmade oven kilned pizzas (which severely raised our pizza standards), to the PMs for patiently answering all our questions, and to especially to for constantly bugging us to sign up.    From a ninjaboo to a ninjawoo with team jolibeee!",Final Year@SMU | President@SMUWiT | Full Stack Developer

The theme for this year’s hackathon is: How would you deliver to our shippers, drivers and parcel recipients?    Stay tuned for more as Code Dojo 22 unfolds in the next 3 days!","75,464 followers"
"In the latter half of last week, Ninja Van's multi-purpose office space was abuzz with energy as 15 teams joined our inaugural 36-hour #hackathon Code Dojo 22, with some of them joining us virtually.    To better equip the participants for the hackathon, we conducted a series of workshops and networking sessions. , our partner and sponsor, kicked off the session by sharing with participants more about Google's platform and how the different tools can be implemented in their solution for the hackathon.    Participants also had the opportunity to speak to Ninja Van's Product Managers and Software Engineers to gain better insights into some of our logistical challenges before they started to code their solutions.    The top three teams received cash prizes and to add to the excitement, a lucky few also walked away with fabulous prizes.    “I hope that the participants learnt how to bootstrap and create a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) in these 36 hours. I am impressed at the result as it was a difficult task but made possible with new and modern technology available on the Google Cloud platform. To participants, I hope that all of you had much fun at Code Dojo 22, and have drawn much learning and insights to inspire you to continue creating. ” — , Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Ninja Van Group.
