We discussed with SCDF on harnessing the strength of technology and people which forms the foundation of our partnerships, including SCDF and DELL Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022. We showcased some of these solutions that are built on such principles and also shared with SCDFs on our partnerships with key global cities in their digitalization strategies and implementations. 

Singapore is our APJ headquarters, home to our Global Innovation Hub under our 'Digital Future- Made in Singaporeâ€™ initiative, and an important market for us. We continue to deliver our commitment to empower 5,000 tertiary students with in-demand tech skills over the next 2 years. Together with SCDF, we hope to tap on their innovative development, bring new testbeds that leverage on technology & innovation, to move Singapore closer to the be a nation of lifesavers.

2,"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place.

I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Terence Poh Aaron K. Godwinn W. Rachel Ow Yeong

Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.

Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act. 

The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.

Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me. 

Special Thanks
Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Eugene Swee and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon. #innovation #cloud #hackathon"
3,"I am proud to announce that my TEAM TAGAR came in 2nd Place in SCDF and Dellâ€™s Innovation Lifesaversâ€™ Innovation Challenge 2022.

This summer break (1/6/22 â€“ 9/7/22), I took the opportunity to push myself further by attending my first innovation/ hackathon â€“ SCDF and Dellâ€™s Innovation Lifesaversâ€™ Innovation Challenge 2022- together with my TAGAR teammates: Terence Poh Alexander Goh Godwinn Wong Rachel Ow Yeong

Our project idea aimed to help reduce SCDF Paramedicsâ€™ cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network and displaying it with an easy to read and user-friendly UI. Furthermore, we made case-specific Just-in-Time revision easily accessible through our application.

Having served national service, we understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid special attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. Our solution then aimed to maximise their germane load by improving the processes without placing change on the way they think or operate. 

Working with cloud computing technologies was a first for me. It was a gruelling task to design and develop a cloud-native minimal viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to VMwareâ€™s cloud. I gain valuable knowledge on project management using an Agile Framework as well as crucial developer skills such as Flask, Laravel, and VMware Tanzu Application Service. This hackathon gave me the confidence that I lacked, and I am extremely happy to have participated and given it my all. If given the opportunity, my team and I look forward to furthering the development of the product.

Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Eugene Swee and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon. Last but not least, the men and women from the 4th SCDF DIV HQ for the valuable sharing sessions.

The past few months has been an exciting time where the Cloud Native Architecture (CNA) team, Dell Technologies worked closely with the Singapore Civil Defence Force to support participants from various Institutes of Higher Learning in their journeys to address emergency preparedness and pre-hospital medical care. 

We shared our expertise in Cloud Native Technologies and Agile Software Development as the teams progressed through their Hackathon journeys. Talent has been, and will continue to be key in transforming technology into impactful, innovative ideas. We are committed to continue providing our expertise and supporting the developments of such innovative solutions. 

Special thanks to our colleagues and partners who contributed to making the Hackathon a success.

5,"As part of Dell Technologies' initiatives in shaping the next generation of tech talent, we collaborate with strategic partners such as Singapore Civil Defence Force. SCDF and Dell Lifesaversâ€™ Innovation Challenge is a platform where these talents can exercise their creativity and technical knowledge to address real-life problem statements. 
 
These 3 students from the top team of 2022's SCDF and Dell Lifesaversâ€™ Innovation Challenge applied separately to the hackathon. They were grouped together to improve the emergency services attendance. Read on to find out how this trio used technology to reduce the cognitive workload of paramedics, enabling them to focus on what they did best.
