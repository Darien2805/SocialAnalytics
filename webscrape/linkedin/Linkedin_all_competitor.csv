24,"Good morning, hope y'all had a great long weekend! Over the last couple of days #Debitsuisse #creditsuisse Credit Suisse arose. The remarks and attempts to calm the market resemble a story being told in 2008. This story ended with circuit breaking a so called ""free market"" because of counterparty risks.  Don't you ever ask yourself why banks get bailed out? Because a central authority can make an exception of their own rules while you cannot. You are being told a story of equality while you are not able to print yourself out of a little financial problem.    The foundation of our economical everyday transactions is based on debts. What's that gotta do with you?  Well, back in 2015 Greece limited withdrawals from bank accounts to 50€/ day because of counterparty risks. In 2021 Canada froze bank accounts based on a political agenda. You are only one state emergency away to loose access to your hard-earned money. What all the above basically means is, they can steal from you, they can control you, they can manipulate you.    On the other side of the isle there is a powerful alternative based on roughly 30.000 lines of code. This technology is so paramountly arrogant that all of its code is open source. Everyone in the world can study it. Challenge it. Debug it.  But no single entity can change the rules. Confiscate your money. Discriminate against you. The beauty of is its simplicity: Rule without rulers. One of the most staggering labels you can put on it is:  Bitcoin is for enemies. Because it is safe. For you. For Them. For everybody. It's your iron dome against invasive governments and it doesn't need to fire a single rocket. Bitcoin is peace. And all you got is co2 emissions to talk me out of it. Come back, when you really thought that through!",At no time in history have the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys.,Good morning hope great long weekend last couple day Debitsuisse creditsuisse Credit Suisse arose remark attempt calm market resemble story told story ended circuit breaking called free market counterparty risk ever ask bank get bailed central authority make exception rule told story equality able print little financial problem foundation economical everyday transaction based debt got ta Well back Greece limited withdrawal bank account day counterparty risk Canada froze bank account based political agenda one state emergency away loose access hard earned money basically mean steal control manipulate side isle powerful alternative based roughly line code technology paramountly arrogant code open source Everyone world study Challenge Debug single entity change rule Confiscate money Discriminate beauty simplicity Rule without ruler One staggering label put Bitcoin enemy safe everybody iron dome invasive government need fire single rocket Bitcoin peace got co emission talk Come back really thought

We developed a Telegram chatbot that could be integrated into Ninjava's existing platform that would help tackle the communication issues between the drivers and the higher chain of command whenever the driver faced sudden disruptions during delivery. Potential iterations could include Voice to text NLP as well as analytics to aid in route planning and parcel delivery optimization.    Even though we did not place in the finals (we were so close), we had a unique and fun experience in Ninjavan.

31,"Over two weeks in August, my team took part in the Accenture University Innovation Challenge 2022, where we were challenged to come up with innovative solutions to accelerate the adoption of EVs in Singapore. I’m delighted to share that we were selected to be one of the 6 teams in the Finals, out of the 91 teams that participated in this Challenge.    For two weeks, my team researched and came up with all sorts of awesome ideas, from wireless charging to EV leasing, and we even wrangled with a huge concept of smart cities and logistics at some point. Finally, we decided to pursue a platform that provides real-time, accurate data on EV charging locations for consumers, as well as analytics for EV-related data that are collected from our platform. It brought together relevant stakeholders, such as the government, private companies, as well as consumers, and we projected to increase the EV uptake in Singapore by 30%! We saw potential in analysing such data for REITs in future as well, as research showed a correlation between EV charging stations and retail traffic in shopping malls.    I would like to thank:  Our mentor , who shared his own interesting experiences and insights about the EV industry and stakeholders to us.  My teammates: , , , , for the amazing job while we were all juggling full-time internships during this challenge.

GNAM (Global Network for Advanced Management) week 2022 () at was one of the major highlights so far, widening my understanding on digital transformation. Started off the week by hearing from the man himself, David Erixon, about the absolute necessity for an organization to be a distinguisher in the digital age with a focus on ""better and cheaper' product to stay ahead of competition. However its intriguing to note that not everyone is following the same formula as evidenced by ' s pricing of its latest VR headset at a heavy price tag of $1500 (though not a cheaper product, but definitely an improved version of its predecessor as per initial reviews). Panel discussion at office as part of was really interesting as senior management gave thoughtful perspectives on the interoperability and sustainability of business models (say digital avatars) across metaverse platforms (ie. not just 's metaverse). 's research on building sustainable business models for Metaverse is really a good one to start with to understand about this topic.    Another highlight of the week was knowing about 's research and development of Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure, which will be pathbreaking in reducing energy consumption once widely implemented.    visit during the week gave valuable lessons on innovation, customer relationship management, sales and resource allocation.    visit was an eye opener on the opportunities and challenges on digital transformation faced by organisations.

142,"TLDR: (AKA grab a coffee...)    Flashback to the beforetimes of October 2019, and I decided to leave the safety nest (a net that had become a cozy home) of Accenture to join a tiny chemical innovation startup, BPS Technology, LLC. They asked me to help refine their marketing strategy. I embraced the chance to stretch my legs. Flashforward to January 2022, and again they asked me to stretch. This time as their Chief Strategy Officer.    I've always loved doing marketing that's very close to the business. And boy have I learned a lot about the business of chemicals, horticulture, commodity agriculture, fertilizer, oil and gas, and supramolecular chemistry. But now they've entrusted me with a bigger vision. (, I'm grateful for the opportunity!)    Being at a startup on the cutting edge of scientific discovery is more than I could have ever dreamed. Getting to help refine our mission, vision, and value proposition has been a delight and a challenge. I've had to call in peers and advisors (looking at you, , , ) to advance us along the way, and we still have really good work to do.    It's been a privilege to tell our story. Whether it's a step change in environmentally conscious oil and gas production; improving corn yields with better fertilizer efficiency; better cannabis production with bolstered bud yield; or seeing greenhouse growers get better turn times and plant health--our patented supramolecular chemistry is first-of-its-kind and delivers remarkable results. I shake my head every day at trial results and customer testimonials. Mind. Blowing. (Thanks , , , , , and many others for so much astounding fodder!)    So yes, this is a new chapter. One of personal growth. One of a startup at the tipping point. One of sustainability (that makes my environmentalist heart pitter-patter). One of faith. Thanks for reading along with me.

157,"After the disruption caused by the last couple of years on every aspect of our lives, it’s only natural that we rethink our relationship not only with technology and brand, but with society and the planet overall.     That is the core premise of the latest trend report from (Trends 2022), that looks at a post-pandemic world where we are creating new perspectives to answer to our new realities. The way people will engage with technology and businesses is definitely changing, and those brands and organisations that manage to understand this and consider it in their products and services will get a step ahead.     Always an interesting read, here are our key takeaways from the 5 major trends presented in Fjord’s report:    𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞: “The rising individualism underlined by a “me over we” mentality is stressing empathy between colleagues within companies and changing people’s aspirations as consumers, which presents new challenges and opportunities for employers and brand owners alike”.     𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐛𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠: “When designing for the balance between affordability and sustainability, organizations need to decouple innovation from the notion of “new”.    𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐫: “The metaverse is less about a world of unicorns and dragons, and more about escaping the limits of physical walls to spend time in a virtual world”.     𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞: “Brand conversations with customers will evolve to structurally solve the challenge of providing the right answer at the right time and in the right way”.     𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞:“Care has moved center stage, reminding us of the importance of kindness and compassion. The many different aspects of care, the challenges of caring, and the cost and role of carers have become more visible and more widely discussed. This is creating opportunities and challenges for all employers and brands— health and non-health. How companies design for all aspects of care will likely set them apart, and be a key component for future success”.","4,644 followers",disruption caused last couple year every aspect life natural rethink relationship technology brand society planet overall core premise latest trend report Trends look post pandemic world creating new perspective answer new reality way people engage technology business definitely changing brand organisation manage understand consider product service get step ahead Always interesting read key takeaway major trend presented Fjord report rising individualism underlined mentality stressing empathy colleague within company changing people aspiration consumer present new challenge opportunity employer brand owner alike designing balance affordability sustainability organization need decouple innovation notion new metaverse le world unicorn dragon escaping limit physical wall spend time virtual world Brand conversation customer evolve structurally solve challenge providing right answer right time right way Care ha moved center stage reminding u importance kindness compassion many different aspect care challenge caring cost role carers become visible widely discussed creating opportunity challenge employer brand health non health company design aspect care likely set apart key component future success

This size and breadth bring significant climate and socio -economic impacts —and opportunities.    The environmental statistics are well known. Estimates of up to 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are attributed to the entire product life cycle from materials production, preparation to logistics, and product use, according to the UN Environment Program.    Textiles consume some 215 trillion liters of water per year, with chemicals, detergents, and microfibers being released in both production and consumer use.

207,"One Year (Oct 1st, 2021 – Oct. 1st, 2022)!    Today I mark one year since joining Accenture !    In my 35 years of being a holistic patient-centered physician and transformational leader, I’ve been grateful to have got mental clarity to discover my true purpose and the right “doses” of energy and intrinsic motivation for dedicating myself daily to what really-really-really matters to me:    creating for many human beings on this planet the conditions for an healthy, happy and purposeful life and to become the best version of themselves.    Today I just feel the need to express, from the bottom of my heart, my deepest gratitude for ALL the amazing people and opportunities I’ve encountered on my Accenture path to make an impact, personally and with my Accenture teams, in this past year.    Differently from many others in my same age, who are mainly busy with their retirement plans, I love still working at the new version of myself for the next 30 years, remaining inspired to keep supporting the physical and mental health and well-being of other people.    For one year I felt committed myself to contribute to the vision and execution of to bring human potential and digital health technology together - in a future global metaverse with a deep emphasis on Humanity.    I’ve learned so much in this past year, but I’ll share with you these three pearls:    1. Care for the people.  With all that we’ve collectively experienced in recent years, it’s been proven that the health of business has never been more reliant and dependent on the health of its people. Caring for the people, with empathy, is a business imperative.    2. Become your best self, authentically.  Many days, like many of you, I thrive on getting things done, working at several exciting project at the same time. Bringing my whole self to work and life. However, I’ve come to appreciate that high performance can only be sustainable if you take care not only of your FLOW moments, but also of your recovery phases. And so, on one side, DEEP WORK TIME is as important as RECOVERY TIME, so that I can be at my best every day. On the other side, we ALL are a “multiplicity symphony of several selves”. Therefore, we should not only become the best version of our self, but also ""orchestrating the symphony of our selves"". Being authentic and contextually focused, with the ""right temporary self"" at the “right time”, with the “right people”.    3. Keep learning.  In challenging oneself and the status quo to learn/take on something new/be disruptive, we have the opportunity to discover, transform, grow,innovate.    There aren’t enough words to fully express my gratitude to you - my Accenture peers, friends, and CALs - who partnered with me to lead this important work and created space for me to learn and lead authentically.    Be Authentic in FLOW !

210,"Being a student at ALU means being ready to DO HARD THINGS and pushing your limits to an extent you won’t have imagined. The 2021/2022 academic year naturally came with its challenges but the most decisive period was the summer; a time when each student had to find a meaningful and fulfilling internship to work on.     I started my internship applications in tech, finance and marketing companies/ start-ups in March 2022. I applied to , , , , etc but guess what? All I got were rejections. I got rejected by about 10 companies and it started getting frustrating since May(the start of the internship period) was fast approaching. As a result, my friend and I decided to move from office to office to deposit our cover letters and resumes. We went to the heart of the innovative centre in Mauritius (Moka) armed with our printed resumes and cover letters- we walked from company to company trying to meet the HR managers, in some we met them, in others we needed appointments and other simply did not receive us. The exercise was really tiring but got exciting when we got guaranteed by HSBC that we would likely receive a call from them. Long story short, after depositing our documents to eight (8) different companies, we did not even get a rejection email, talk less of a call.     Back to reality and understanding that it would not be that easy to get an internship, I changed my strategy and had to revamp my entire CV, modify my cover letter to a more suitable format and apply to even more companies. I finally got 4 amazing offers; 3 for marketing positions and one for a business development position. I eventually decided to work with as the Marketing acquisition intern and with which is a Canada-registered Kenyan-based advisory group, as a business development and investor relations intern. The months that followed were very intense, but at the same time really enriching. I learned myriad things from both teams: building and monitoring marketing strategies that generated over 200000+ leads, doing financial forecasts and modelling alongside building investor teasers and briefs for start-up and institutional investors.     My appreciations go to who has been nothing but a very keen supporting manager, my Marketing director with his excellent sense of detail and leadership, her remarkable vision for impact investment (especially gender lens) and for her incredible coordination and operation management skills.

More importantly, what is it NOT?  It is NOT picking up the existing business processes and incorporating digital technologies in them. It’s also not just adding technology to the offerings.  It’s rather a holistic evaluation of the business processes, workflows, products/services and company culture to strategize, innovate and embrace the methods, practices and technologies that would make the business resilient and adaptable to future challenges.

221,"The Life Sciences is an exciting industry, constantly evolving and leading the way in innovation, and with the emergence of technology, the Life Sciences Industry seems to be pointed in the direction of the Metaverse.    Trend 8: Metaverse Technology    According to a recent Accenture report ‘Life Sciences Technology Vision 2022’, industry leaders expect the metaverse to have a strong impact on their organizations.    Despite the metaverse still being in its early days, the report claims that the Life Sciences industry is ripe for integrating further pioneering digital solutions within the metaverse for how people and organisations interact. The report details how four technological cornerstones could underpin the sector’s entry into the metaverse:    WebMe explores how the internet is used to create digital experiences between people and organisations. WebMe would reinvent how data can be owned by individuals, as it would be shifted with the person and not the platform.    The Programmable World tracks how technology is being weaved through our physical environments in three layers: connected, experiential, and material. Nearly nine-in-10 of the MedTech and biopharma executives surveyed in the report believe that programming the physical environment will emerge as a competitive differentiation in their industry.    The Unreal explores the more ‘unreal’ qualities that are becoming fundamental to artificial intelligence as well as data, making the synthetic seem authentic. This realistic (yet ‘unreal’) data can be shared, maintaining the same statistical properties while protecting confidentiality and privacy. It can be developed to accommodate increased diversity to counter bias, thus overcoming the pitfalls of real-world data.    Computing the Impossible is the emergence of a new class of machines - ‘quantum computing’ - which stretches the boundaries of what computers are capable of. Problems once thought impossible to solve because they require computing large, complex datasets are now in the realm of possibility.

227,"Accenture released their Fjord Trends 2022 near the end of last year. The report identifies five major emerging trends & challenges that have significant implications for the year:  1. Come as you are. We’re starting to see an era of post-traumatic opportunity (my term) take shape. One study found that some 71% of executives said 2020 was their most stressful work year ever and 53% reported struggling with mental health issues at work, while 76% of employees believe their employers should take more responsibility for their mental wellbeing. Two-thirds of UK and US study participants, and almost all in China, India and South Africa said they have changed the way they think about purpose at work.  2. The end of abundance thinking. Global shortages and lockdowns have permeated, creating a sense that we need to consume less and give back more. Climate change has also accelerated thinking around increased sustainability and new expectations of convenience. Companies are now decoupling ""innovation"" and ""new"" and are thinking differently about value creation (less doesn't have to mean loss -- do we need new smart gadgets every year?).  3. Digital culture is accelerating. The move to converge physical and digital worlds (again) is bringing a new rush to investment in digital assets that mimic our physical world. 75% of those polled in this study were excited about the future of their digital experiences, citing things like improved communications between people, better access to information, and a more convenient life. Companies need to embrace entirely new ways of formulating digital strategies for both employees and customers.  4. Human expectations for answers have evolved. A generation after the founding of Google, we now expect immediate answers to any question we have. Furthermore, we are less trusting of information sources outside of our own social cohorts. Nine out of ten customers seek information about products/services online before they make a purchasing decision. Brands are now formulating new information layers across all customer touchpoints. These layers must be transparent and simple.  5. People's default is now care and compassion. In the UK, 87% of HR leaders have experienced increased numbers of employees disclosing issues around mental health, and 82% have seen greater numbers of staff reporting feelings of loneliness. 73% of people around the world now consider “wellness” an essential element of any brand’s strategy.

233,"METAVERSE MONDAY: At this year's International Economic Development Council Annual Conference, over 80 attendees to a session on the #metaverse responded to a poll about their familiarity with this emerging technology.    Responses indicated that community leaders' awareness and level of understanding aligned roughly to that of the average U.S. consumer.    The challenge is that according to recent research, business leaders are leaning in to this at a much higher rate, gaining both conversancy as well as pursuing adoption of the metaverse for value creation and .    As leaders, we must stay ahead of emerging technology trends so that we can serve our community's employers, residents, and tax base, and innovate in our own right.    There's a issue at stake as well: while we are in the early days of the metaverse, leaders who shy away from the uncertainty of the metaverse will soon be operating in worlds defined by others.    The purpose of sharing this information is not to fearmonger, but to signal to our profession that we have an opportunity to create immense value in every community, alongside good jobs, and innovative ways to deliver public services to residents.

244,"5G development, implementation and disruptiveness continue to gather attention and foster debate among policymakers and researchers.    5G will provide the basis for digitization in many areas of our lives and will influence a broad spectrum of sectors. The full realisation of the Internet of Things (IoT), often called the next Industrial Revolution, relies on 5G development. A current estimate foresees that there will be up to 26 billion connected devices by 2026 (Ericsson, 2021). The global economic impact of 5G is expected to be enormous: up to €2.0 trillion in sales growth and 20 million jobs across all sectors of the economy between 2021-2025 (Accenture, 2021).    Recognizing the importance of understanding the many nuances and implications of 5G technologies, Telecommunications Policy will be publishing a new special issue on ‘Innovation in 5G technology: leadership, competition and policy issues’ (2022). Contributions to the special issue provide insights on the opportunities and challenges raised by the implementation of 5G across sectors and explore potential implications for policy.

252,"The best news 📰 in 2022 to date! Globe Business won 3 awards for ANVIL Awards!!!    Wooohooooo Congratulations to the Globe Business Enterprise Group!!! 🎉🎉🎉    LEAD-IN 2020    Overcoming Fear & Uncertainty    2020 was a year where enterprises had to take the biggest pivot in recent history in more ways than one. COVID-19 had impacted the lives of people globally, creating a halo effect on business growth and operations. Philippine enterprises, while constantly evolving, needed to accelerate their digital transformation. Facing much uncertainty, enterprises could not make themselves victims of circumstance, but rather, frontiers of courageous leadership and drivers of innovative culture.    Enterprise leaders needed guidance and strength during this time, which Globe Business provided through the annual Leadership Innovation Forum (Lead-In). The theme of the event was “Forward & Fearless: A Path Towards a Braver Tomorrow.” It aimed to inspire and enable a culture of digital transformation through courageous leadership at all levels of the organization. Adapting to the new normal, the format had changed from face-to-face engagement to a virtual event.    CLOCKWORK WEBISODES    Getting to know CEOs inside and beyond the boardroom    To ensure that the interview was more entertaining than the typical webinars that enterprise leaders are used to, Clockwork was divided into segments that showed the different sides of the guest CEOs. The first segment dwelled on the more human-interest side of things as CEOs shared their secrets and habits that made them who they are today. The show's second segment then zoomed in on exciting new technologies, success stories, and innovations that challenge the norm. Furthermore, the show does not constrain itself to discuss only solutions carried by Globe today. All schools of thought, processes, and technologies brought up by the guests may guide customers in developing or redeveloping their own processes.    The first three episodes of the series featured some of the most successful people in the Philippines: Ernest Cu (President and CEO of Globe Telecom), Ray Alimurung (CEO of Lazada Group Philippines), and Lito Tayag (Country Managing Director of Accenture Philippines). These three business leaders kept the discussions light and more interesting. These episodes were then amplified through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Youtube.

263,"THE METAVERSE NEEDS TO GET REAL!    It seems only five minutes ago that we were talking about Web 2.0, virtual reality, blockchain and artificial intelligence. Now they have all been merged together to create the metaverse. A virtual world which as Mark Zuckerberg says is “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”    Sounds cool doesn't it? Well, I'm not so sure. Its certainly being hyped. Facebook renamed itself Meta, Accenture's 2022 Technology Vision report is called 'Meet me in the Metaverse' and Microsoft cited it as a reason for acquiring Activision Blizzard, saying the deal would provide ""building blocks for the metaverse.""    The term metaverse comes straight out of science fiction, coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book Snow Crash, and lots of people plan to make money off of it.    Apparently gaming, avatars and virtual worlds will soon be essential to our lives. Deloitte touts its metaverse capabilities as offering 'an innovation space where Deloitte professionals and clients can develop and test break-through capabilities that leverage virtual worlds powered by enabling technologies.' That's a lot of buzzwords for one sentence!    PWC says 'The metaverse promises a stunningly realistic 3D digital world where you can (for example) purchase and sell goods and services, sign and enforce contracts, recruit and train talent, and interact with customers and communities.'  Not much there about making the world a better place.    So the metaverse is all about creating a virtual representation of the real world so you can make more money. Why do we need another world? I know real life is tough but is the answer to replicate it and then allow you to pretend to be someone you're not, doing something you can't, in a place where you don't exist, to earn rewards that aren't real?    I've been involved in technology for almost 45 years and have seen a lot of 'waves' and 'breakthroughs' most of which promised more than they delivered.    Creating value means delivering something that's useful. At the moment most of the discussion seems to surround peripheral use cases--games, social media, crypto, NFTs, etc. I am much more interested to see how the metaverse is going to help address real world's biggest challenges.

264,"""Capital is super-abundant in this world today: listed companies have trillions of dollars at their disposal. But while financial capital may not a problem for them, human capital is rare.    And yet, human capital is vital – it’s the competitive advantage, it's what companies should be caring about. All the money in the world can't replace the work we do that comes out of a particular passion or purpose.    Industry so often forgets that. I regularly see companies neglecting the biggest asset they have: their people. I have heard business leaders claim that people will be replaced by robots; I hear dire predictions of a “jobless future”. Apparently, 67% of CEOs believe technology, not people, is the key to survival.    It's true that Artificial Intelligence, automation and other new technologies are becoming hugely important for business. According to Accenture, AI has the potential to boost rates of profitability by an average of 38% by 2035 and lead to an economic boost of US$14 trillion across 16 industries in 12 economies by 2035.    But the way so many leaders think about change, digital innovation and the workplace is all wrong. Rather than focusing on how technology will de-humanise the workplace, we should be thinking about how we can use it to amplify human potential. It can’t be about destroying human relations or we have no future as a planet!    Amplifying human potential    At the core of what brings innovation, ideas and progress is us – human beings. Our ideas, our passions, our ability to innovate, our creativity, those are the things that actually create the solutions to the big challenges this world is facing.    Technology must be a catalyst for positive transformation: it must help us ignite the human spark. Technology must help us find our purpose, identify the right people for the right roles, elevate our learning and nurture our mental health.    That human spark is what I care about: creativity, empathy, innovation, communication, connection. It's about being more human, not less.""        . (2022). LinkedIn.

266,"Oracle, Accenture, Volkswagen, Boeing, Apple, Exxon, H&M, Maersk, IKEA, most European multinationals are dropping out. As an energy giant, will Russia be building a new ecosystem?    Since the post Soviet era and 1998 banking collapse, Western capital and corporates has been flowing into Russia, with a large acceleration following the globalisation in year 2000. All this came to a sharp disruption in 2014 when the Russia-Ukraina war first started. Russia is a European country, although mindsets are different, Russians are great at doing business with Europeans. However, in 2013, Russian FDI, two thirds from EU, was only representing 2-3% of Russia's GDP, roughly at par with the energy export value and double of all other exports. Since then Russian GDP has fallen by 25%.    So, who is the new taker of the Russian economy. China is not only laughing at the West, they are laughing at Russia. With excess of ""blood-stained"" energy supplies, there is only one market. Whilst logistical challenges are many, over time China can secure a cheap flow of energy.    And, who will develop Russian businesses? Putin's 20 years has rendered in a business environment led by cronies with stagnating development. When did you last hear about innovation and Russia in one sentence? Their digital economy is still only ranked #41 in the global ICT development index and the number of unicorns are only 1/4 of those from Denmark. 1/2 of Indonesia, and at par with Malta and Philippines. There are many local brands and strong local wealth, however the money is flowing into European brands (many exempt from sanctions BTW.).    At the end of the day, an resource-rich economy, full of cronyism, and with a solid consumer wealth. Who might be interested? Consumer brands, industrial supplies, and energy trade. Looks like like it is not the last time we saw Putin and Xi Jinping together. And, increasingly, Putin will realise that Xi Jinping is the taller one. Obama did his Pivot to asia in 2012, Putin in 2022.    And congratulations China!",JAPAC Business Value Director at Oracle Strategic Clients Group | Shaping client value roadmap and tech-led transformations,Oracle Accenture Volkswagen Boeing Apple Exxon H Maersk IKEA European multinationals dropping energy giant Russia building new ecosystem Since post Soviet era banking collapse Western capital corporates ha flowing Russia large acceleration following globalisation year came sharp disruption Russia Ukraina war first started Russia European country although mindset different Russians great business Europeans However Russian FDI two third EU wa representing Russia GDP roughly par energy export value double export Since Russian GDP ha fallen new taker Russian economy China laughing West laughing Russia excess blood stained energy supply one market Whilst logistical challenge many time China secure cheap flow energy develop Russian business Putin year ha rendered business environment led crony stagnating development last hear innovation Russia one sentence digital economy still ranked global ICT development index number unicorn Denmark Indonesia par Malta Philippines many local brand strong local wealth however money flowing European brand many exempt sanction BTW end day resource rich economy full cronyism solid consumer wealth might interested Consumer brand industrial supply energy trade Looks like like last time saw Putin Xi Jinping together increasingly Putin realise Xi Jinping taller one Obama Pivot asia Putin congratulation China

The subject of CBDC has provoked some vociferous discussion lately. The advocates believe that CBDC can accelerate financial depth, stimulate innovation, and act as a catalyst for digitization in payments. Its opponents worry that it may disrupt the banking system and undermine existing banks' business models.    Adding urgency to debates over CBDCs promises and ramifications is the rise in private sector crypto assets that endanger the role of fiat money and reduction in use of physical notes fueled by lockdowns covid-induced lockdowns.    That over 80% of central banks have dived head-first into the CBDC abyss is the harbinger of things to come.    This blog shines the spotlight on the driving factors fueling CBDC pilots across the globe, the barriers to its widespread acceptance, and the implications for commercial banks, regulators, and end-users.

10,"8 years ago, studying at Zewail City was just a ""dream"" for me. Two weeks ago, I graduated from Zewail City of Science and Technology!     In school, I have always been a top achiever. I got the First Place award in my senior year (Thanaweya Amma) for the highest grade in my school. However, I still doubted whether I could pass the university's admission tests! I decided to give it a try and studied for them, but I wasn't satisfied at all with my performance. I was quite sure that I won't get accepted. But then, I got accepted! (The impostor phenomenon had another opinion though😂)     During my college days, I always believed that my work in the courses, especially projects, isn't good enough. Throughout these 5 years, I tried to make use of every single opportunity to learn and grow. I was NEVER satisfied and that had always pushed me to work even harder!      In my journey, I KNEW that if I can't understand any concept, there was always someone (a student/ Dr/ TA) here to help, without anything in return!     In my journey, I met the best and smartest people ever. Being surrounded by them has developed my way of thinking. Also, being part of a community from diverse backgrounds with different points of view has made me more flexible and open-minded.     In my journey, I always felt blessed for studying a field that I'm really PASSIONATE about by the most wonderful professors.     In my journey, I unlocked capabilities in myself that I didn’t know existed, either through student activities/ competitions/ group projects.     In my journey, I discovered that I was a perfectionist! I wanted everything to be 100% perfect, and that was the reason why I always doubted myself and was never satisfied with my performance!   “Until you realize perfection is an ideal and not a reality, you will never have self-confidence.” ― J.S. Felts     But then,  I learned that perfectionism is an “illusion”. There is nothing perfect. I was trying to reach something that didn’t exist and doubted myself for not succeeding! Now, I seek “balance”. Balance is the key. I try to produce the best possible outcome within the given time. Efficiency!  “Be prolific, not perfect.” ―Richie Norton  “Imperfection facilitates improvement, perfection facilitates stagnation.” ―Abhijit Naskar    Finally, I graduated with an Excellent degree and a recognition medal for serving the ZC community through winning first place in Dell's hackathon and participating in a student activity (IEEE) as a head of a team in a major event. Also, I got straight A's in all of the courses in my senior year in both semesters (GPA 4.00/4.00), which was one of the hardest years. On top of that, I and my team won first place in CIE Projects Exhibition 2022 for the best graduation project.     Do not seek perfectionism, just focus on “improvement”.    That was just a glimpse of my journey in Zewail City.  I believe I'm ready for the next steps!",Data Engineer @adam.ai,year ago studying Zewail City wa dream Two week ago graduated Zewail City Science Technology school always top achiever got First Place award senior year Thanaweya Amma highest grade school However still doubted whether could pas university admission test decided give try studied satisfied performance wa quite sure get accepted got accepted impostor phenomenon another opinion though college day always believed work course especially project good enough Throughout year tried make use every single opportunity learn grow wa NEVER satisfied always pushed work even harder journey KNEW understand concept wa always someone student Dr TA help without anything return journey met best smartest people ever surrounded ha developed way thinking Also part community diverse background different point view ha made flexible open minded journey always felt blessed studying field really PASSIONATE wonderful professor journey unlocked capability know existed either student activity competition group project journey discovered wa perfectionist wanted everything perfect wa reason always doubted wa never satisfied performance realize perfection ideal reality never self confidence J Felts learned perfectionism illusion nothing perfect wa trying reach something exist doubted succeeding seek balance Balance key try produce best possible outcome within given time Efficiency prolific perfect Richie Norton Imperfection facilitates improvement perfection facilitates stagnation Abhijit Naskar Finally graduated Excellent degree recognition medal serving ZC community winning first place Dell hackathon participating student activity IEEE head team major event Also got straight course senior year semester GPA wa one hardest year top team first place CIE Projects Exhibition best graduation project seek perfectionism focus improvement wa glimpse journey Zewail City believe ready next step

48,"Last Thursday, I was privileged enough to participate in Dell's Virtual Hack2Hire hackathon as my first real-deal hackathon (develop a prototype in under 24 hours). Co-leading the team alongside Daniel Wan Jonathan was no doubt an eye-opening experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:    1. Emphasis on each members' expertise is paramount to your team's success. Since this was our first time working on a fast-paced project, a slight lack of expertise in a certain domain/framework can slow down your progress by a considerable degree.    2. “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” – Benjamin Franklin. The planning phase in software development is crucial when working with a deadline. Even though our team took the initiative to break down the modules to be developed using Trello, we realized certain key aspects were left out eg. the wireframing of our user interface, as too much emphasis was placed on the backend logic of our application.    3. Communication is key when attempting to convey your ideas to your team members and stakeholders. As future developers, the ability to think clearly determines your ability to relay information. Clear thinking == clear communication.    All in all, I want to give a huge shoutout to my Logos teammates , and for tanking through a whole day of continuous coding, as well as for mentoring us from the development side of things all the way to the presentation. Although we couldn't achieve exactly what we initially set out to do, we definitely had a ton of fun and learned a lot along the way under your mentorship.    I would also like to thank for the internship opportunity for my next semester.

I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Godwinn W.    Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.    Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act.    The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.

Fui aprendiendo de grandes tutores que no solamente me transmitieron “hard skills” y enseñaron herramientas nuevas, sino que por sobre todo me ayudaron a entender mucho mas en profundidad el significado de trabajo de equipo, dedicación y empatía.    Este fin de semana pasado tuvo lugar el Fiubaton, evento de hackathon de innovación creado por el Club en 2019, evento del cual pude tener el honor de haber sido coorganizador junto con y . Para el evento en cuestión, teníamos como objetivo inculcar los valores y visión del Club en los participantes, para así trasmitirles nuestra motivación para salir al mundo con una cabeza bien abierta. El evento alcanzó a tener a mas de 150 participantes, contando con la participación de mas de 30 integrantes del Club que se desvivieron por que todo salga lo mejor posible.    A pesar de ser ya Senior en el Club, este evento me enseño un par de lecciones. Por un lado, gracias a Matías pude aprender que por más imposible que se vea una situación o inconveniente, con perseverancia y trabajo duro (también con un ocasional alooo) siempre se sale adelante. Por otra parte, Marcos me enseñó a que a veces la solución es mucho más simple de lo que aparenta y cómo ganarse el corazón de la gente que te rodea (y que no existe un número suficiente de fosforítos).    Finalmente, el me demostró nuevamente el gran corazón que tiene y que siempre pero siempre ponerse la camiseta con el logo del alfil vale la pena.

130,"‼️ Facciamo il punto, dopo 3 anni di business a #Palermo 🤯    Una città dove le realtà IT più innovative fanno siti web in WordPress e vendono corsi che ti promettono di cambiare la tua vita, manco fossero Tony Robbins.    Un territorio dove il concetto di coworking è ridotto ad un luogo che affitta stanze (rigorosamente riservate. Non sia mai ti rubino un cliente).    Dove personaggi di dubbia professionalità si spacciano per Advisor, Trainer e Startup Coach quando non hanno mai avuto un successo nel business.    Dove le aziende ti nascondo al loro team per paura che uno dei loro talenti, appena formato nello sviluppo in jQuery (e pagato in buoni pasto) possa venire a lavorare per la tua azienda.    Dove “ti pago in visibilità” e “lavorare in modo flessibile” significa fare 12 ore di lavoro al giorno mentre vieni assunto part-time.    Dove è più importante apparire.  Non importa se su un social mentre alzi il “Premio Barzotto” o su un articolo nel giornale del paese.    Per non parlare dei vari hackathon e pseudo startup weekend, che l’unica cosa che insegnano è che…bello adesso la mia idea è una startup e posso scrivere “Founder e CEO” sul mio profilo LinkedIn.    Una città che durante le elezioni promuoveva personaggi che sfruttavano l’entusiasmo di giovani startupper raccontando che avrebbero dato loro un’opportunità per costruire una in cambio del loro voto (e se portavi mamma, papà, zio, nonni etc… anche meglio).    Dove le aziende che vantano qualche piccolo successo, se la tirano manco fossero Y Combinator, vivendo di progetti passati di dubbia utilità e finiti miseramente.    Bè cari amici, dovrei dirvi che è una città difficile dove fare business. Dove c’è grande ego e tanta ipocrisia, ma devo dirvi che io a questa città ne sono grato.

It was quite challenging for me as I need to handle my university assignments and competition at the same time. But the good thing that I have taken away from this hackathon is the and that I learned from my team members. Especially when it comes to the knowledge that I never learned before, I have to learn myself in a limited time and it was also my first time designing the user interface to be a front-end developer. Special thanks to my team members for guiding me to make a whole complete project as well as all the mentors that gave us advice. Even though we didn't win, I am overall more than proud of the great effort that we put in during this hackathon. After this, I would definitely brush up on my knowledge and skills to become stronger in the future.    Lastly, congratulations to all the winners.

175,"Today marks the end of my 12-week internship journey as a Worldwide Procurement Intern in Dell Technologies. Recognised as having one of the world's best supply chains, I applied for an internship position here with the intention of learning from world-class industry experts in the supply-chain field. After 3 months here in Dell, I can confidently say that I have left with so much more.     For me, the biggest takeaway from Dell is to dig deep and always be curious. When I first stepped into the office, I was immediately introduced to the concept of 1X1s - 1 on 1 meetings with any partner to learn more about their work function or to gain insights on a particular issue. Questions are welcomed, if not highly encouraged, in Dell and despite how busy the managers and mentors were, my questions were always thoughtfully answered. This has helped me gain tons of insights not only in procurement, but in other job functions as well.     On top of this, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities all interns were given to showcase and refine our skills. There was never a dull day in the office. From hackathons to projects focused on aiding the team solve real-world issues, we were constantly being challenged to think critically and analytically. Though I admit it got hectic at times, the warm and supportive culture in Dell was of great help through these tough times.     Although this 12-week internship was just the tip of the iceberg into the procurement field, my perspective has definitely broadened from the numerous 1X1s, Brown Bags, Executive Speaker Series, networking sessions and department events with the outstanding team here in Dell.     I'd like to thank my intern team for being such remarkable group mates to work with and learn from. I am grateful for the team's ""never-say-die"" spirit - supporting each other throughout no matter how tough it got. I'd also like to thank for sacrificing precious work hours to answer our never-ending set of questions and for being the best buddy any intern could ask for. Also huge thanks to for his superb mentorship and perceptive feedback on our projects, Christe Elmenzo for being such a supportive and approachable mentor, for his technical expertise and guidance, and core team for an unforgettable internship programme, and all other interns for such a wholesome and vibrant experience.

Hence we created a mobile application that digitizes handwritten prescriptions, doctor notes, and lab reports by converting images into machine-readable format via Machine Learning Models.

We faced many challenges like; hunting datasets, missing documentation of the technologies, and crashing of the online platform, which supported our Machine learning model during the final demonstration.

L’evento si è svolto in una location davvero suggestiva quale quella delle Scuderie Aldobrandini a Frascati al termine della Settimana della Scienza, targata Frascati Scienza.    📝 Dare consigli ai team su come orientare i loro lavori e allo stesso tempo cercare di rendere accessibili a tutti le loro idee è stato sfidante e gratificante.

238,"Maps Group | Sharing Knowledge e l'#hackathon in sanità    ""AL MIGLIOR PROGETTO DI INNOVAZIONE PER MIGLIORARE LA QUALITA' DI VITA DEI PAZIENTI CON MALATTIE RARE""    Può sembrare un gioco l'hackathon, ma non lo è.  Specialmente se il tema è quello delle malattie rare.  E così, con serietà, concretezza e professionalità abbiamo affrontato un argomento complesso e delicato.  Abbiamo cercato e intervistato chi, in prima persona, vive questa difficoltà, con l'obiettivo di capire e toccare con mano quale sia la quotidianità della vita e cosa davvero potesse essere fatto per innovare e aiutare.    Il team, composto dai colleghi , ha ideato una piattaforma tecnologica dedicata al caregiver. Il progetto si chiama e la finalità è quella di formare al meglio il caregiver per fargli conoscere i vari aspetti della malattia rara in questione e renderlo quindi autonomo - in modo particolare - nei momenti di emergenza.  Una serie di test validano e certificano il livello di preparazione che, via via nel tempo, il caregiver è in grado di assumere.  Inoltre, una community è a disposizione dei caregiver per chi ha bisogno di aiuto e di supporto psicologico.    Come vedete dalla foto, sprizziamo felicità da tutti i pori!!!  Un GRAZIE ENORME va ad che, pur non essendo presente alla premiazione, è stata l'anima del team!  Un altro SUPER GRAZIE alla bravissima , portavoce del gruppo e protagonista dello speech!

Insieme, abbiamo deciso di creare dei momenti corali in cui i partecipanti al programma delle diverse città potessero incontrarsi, costruendo occasioni divertenti ma anche di scambio e di sfida in cui portare alla luce nuove idee per la risoluzione di alcuni dei temi più caldi della contemporaneità.    In quanto partecipanti attivi della nostra società e futuri lavoratori, gli studenti saranno chiamati a ragionare su che cos’è lo sviluppo resiliente, su come migliorare i trasporti e l’accessibilità tramite le tecnologie, su come creare comunità urbane smart, su come favorire la transizione ecologica e su come tutelare il territorio e il suo patrimonio storico-artistico.

I'm extremely delighted to share that our team - SwasthyaVardhak won the in the grand finale held at for working on the Problem Statement given by which aims to digitize doctors' handwriting for easy access to everyone.    We created a mobile application which has a scanner that captures the image of a prescription and converts it into readable format using an ML model in the back-end.    Our team's journey was quite a rollercoaster ride with us being waitlisted in the despite all the hardwork, and loosing hope to be a part of the Finale, then overjoyed when got selected for nationals, working during the pre and the end semester examinations, hunting datasets and coming up with an approach that ditched us in the end, even after that we worked harder and implemented a solution that was up for evaluation, then came the most tragic thing- crashed during the demonstration in the final evaluation. Working hard for sleepless 36+ hours, we did it and the long haul made us win the battle.    Sharing my heartfelt gratitude to my team, winning would have been impossible without all six of us, I couldn't imagine a better team working this hard for SIH.    you were always the overall workforce whether it be the selection of team members, brainstorming over ideas for the problem statements, app designing, and working as well as integrating the model solution.    the most cheerful member, but the most calm and composed person while working, and implementing every possible feature in the application on one single thought is something we couldn't have won without.    working hard and valuing every single work we did, always boosting our morale and making us not loose hope, specially in my case, you were the one who believed our hardwork will surely make us emerge with flying colours.    the epic team player, the true example of working hard in silence and let our success be the noise!, the ""sankat mochan"" of our team as Manish calls you.    here we go, the zero minute inactive member of our team, the caffeine and hardwork addict who worked on every theoretical aspect to be well implemented in our solution.      I'd like to extend a special thanks to our evaluators and mentors , and for the suggestions in our solution. We were overwhelmed by your aura and the knowledge you provided us, most importantly, confiding us that we'll come up with a solution in near future with our continuous efforts.  I'd also like to thank our team mentor Dr. Pratima Singh ma'am and sir for the constant guidance, support and helping us throughout the process.

Occhio soprattutto a non perdere il tuo TEMPO.

276,"🏫Il mondo della #scuola è sempre in evoluzione. Con l’avvento della tecnologia si stanno diffondendo sempre di più gli #Hackathon.    ❓Ma cosa sono?  Iniziamo subito dal termine. La parola Hackathon nasce dall’unione di “hack” (violare, attaccare) e “marathon” (maratona).    Usato per la prima volta nel 1999, il termine hackathon rappresenta eventi no stop con diverse durate (un giorno, una settimana, un weekend…). In queste ore i partecipanti hanno l’opportunità di confrontarsi con esperti di diversi settori: dall’informatica alla didattica, dall’ambiente al sociale.    L’obiettivo di queste “sfide” è centrare in pieno il vero significato della parola competizione che deriva dal latino cum+petere = domandare insieme.  Durante gli hackathon ci si domanda infatti cosa non va attorno a noi e, con , e lungimiranza, si pensa a possibili da applicare per migliorare questi problemi.  Da problema a soluzione quindi. Il tutto viene fatto sviluppando nei partecipanti un’ottica di consapevolezza, responsabilità, lavoro di squadra e innovazione.    🆕Oltre agli hackathon sono sempre più frequenti in Italia progetti innovativi che si basano su una didattica sensoriale e comunicativa. Tra questi c’è il nato ispirandosi alla metodologia Challenge Based Learning (CBL).    Si tratta di un laboratorio didattico-innovativo di mappatura collettiva e partecipata di un luogo. I partecipanti vengono portati in un luogo e immersi tra le bellezze naturali e artificiali dell’uomo devono mettere in connessione i cinque sensi integrando così i dati percettivi con le conoscenze culturali e geografiche di un territorio.    🎯L’obiettivo è trovare soluzioni a problematiche del luogo che generano nei partecipanti delle sensazioni negative o di fastidio. L’obiettivo è stimolare nelle nuove generazioni la capacità di vedere con occhi diversi il territorio e nutrire l’interesse culturale rispetto al valore estetico del posto.",264 followers,Il mondo della scuola sempre evoluzione Con l avvento della tecnologia si stanno diffondendo sempre di pi gli Hackathon cosa sono Iniziamo subito dal termine La parola Hackathon nasce dall unione di hack violare attaccare e marathon maratona Usato per la prima volta nel il termine hackathon rappresenta eventi stop con diverse durate un giorno una settimana un weekend queste ore partecipanti hanno l opportunit di confrontarsi con esperti di diversi settori dall informatica alla didattica dall ambiente al sociale L obiettivo di queste sfide centrare pieno il vero significato della parola competizione che deriva dal latino cum petere domandare insieme Durante gli hackathon ci si domanda infatti cosa non va attorno noi e con e lungimiranza si pensa possibili da applicare per migliorare questi problemi Da problema soluzione quindi Il tutto viene fatto sviluppando nei partecipanti un ottica di consapevolezza responsabilit lavoro di squadra e innovazione Oltre agli hackathon sono sempre pi frequenti Italia progetti innovativi che si basano su una didattica sensoriale e comunicativa Tra questi c il nato ispirandosi alla metodologia Challenge Based Learning CBL Si tratta di un laboratorio didattico innovativo di mappatura collettiva e partecipata di un luogo partecipanti vengono portati un luogo e immersi tra le bellezze naturali e artificiali dell uomo devono mettere connessione cinque sensi integrando co dati percettivi con le conoscenze culturali e geografiche di un territorio L obiettivo trovare soluzioni problematiche del luogo che generano nei partecipanti delle sensazioni negative di fastidio L obiettivo stimolare nelle nuove generazioni la capacit di vedere con occhi diversi il territorio e nutrire l interesse culturale rispetto al valore estetico del posto

279,"🌟 Ringrazio Carloalberto Sartor che, quando abbiamo trattato il tema delle donne che hanno fatto la storia, ha suggerito il grande personaggio di #AdaLovelace. Ada è stata anche la figura di riferimento per l’#AdaHack sull'intelligenza artificiale, uno splendido hackathon in cui ho fatto da mentor per i ragazzi di , nella meravigliosa sede di con , e .    👩 Chi fu Ada? Sicuramente una grande matematica britannica. Nata nel 1815, crebbe senza il padre che lasciò la famiglia quando lei aveva ancora pochi mesi di vita. Fin da giovane si appassionò alle scienze matematiche e durante l’adolescenza fu addirittura considerata da tutti, insegnanti compresi, un piccolo genio. I suoi studi riguardavano in particolar modo la matematica, l’algebra e la tecnologia. Appena diciassettenne incontrò il padre dell’informatica Charles Babbage, con il quale iniziò una bellissima e stretta collaborazione.    👩 Babbage chiese ad Ada di tradurre in inglese i lavori del matematico italiano Luigi Menabrea proprio sulla macchina di Babbage, ma lei oltre alla traduzione aggiunse vari appunti incluso un algoritmo per il calcolo dei numeri di Bernoulli. A partire da questo algoritmo, Ada sviluppò un programma per un calcolatore: questo fu il primo esempio di software della storia, nonché la scoperta più innovativa della scienziata, che gettò le basi della moderna informatica.    👩 Ada morì a soli 36 anni per un tumore ed è considerata anche oggi un simbolo per tutte le donne che dedicano la loro vita alla scienza e alla ricerca, nonostante per lungo tempo il suo contributo venne spesso ignorato e sottovalutato in quanto, all’epoca, gli studi scientifici venivano erroneamente associati solo agli uomini. Nel 1979 però, il Ministero della Difesa statunitense onorò la sua memoria e il suo lavoro chiamando “Ada” un linguaggio di programmazione.    👉 Ci sono altre figure che conosci a cui sei particolarmente affezionato?

Attraverso il PMI Disciplined Agile Business Game di oggi, abbiamo potuto mettere in pratica chiavi fondamentali per conoscere ed utilizzare l'Agile: definire e incrementare la WoW, utilizzare il tool raDAr, costruire dei veri Disciplined Agile Process Goal Diagrams per costruire una Company New Business Strategy, facilitando i processi di leading and decision marking, focalizzandosi sulla formazione e benessere psicologico del team.  La metodologia Agile traduce a pieno il mio mindset e come interpreto i miei obiettivi ogni giorno ( Adapt, Evolve e Respond): negli ultimi anni, infatti, ho cambiato totalmente ambito, adattandomi al mondo in continua evoluzione, ho stravolto la mia mission per rispondere alle challenge del futuro, abbracciando orgogliosamente nuove discipline STEM.

E quero contar um pouco dessa #conquista (e passar umas dicas para os novatos).    Na 1@ imagem, está a máquina onde comecei minha jornada: o DELLzinho (4GB de RAM, HD de 480GB, Processador Core i5 descontinuado, sem placa de vídeo) - foi com isso, onde comecei a em 2019. Ah, e naquela epoca eu tinha pouco !    Na 2@ imagem, está o setup atual: Monitor DELL P2227H, Lenovo IdeaPad S145 (com uma boa configuração), Teclado T-Dagger Bora, Mouse T-Dagger, HeadSet Fortrek G, Caixa JBL GO 3 (e o celular que uso é um Xiaomi Redmi Note 8). Só que, cada item que listei, nesse parágrafo, foi pago com o meu próprio dinheiro (e sim, hoje em dia eu tenho dinheiro! 🙏).    Só que, nesse intervalo de 3 anos, aconteceram muitas coisas que eu não esperava que me levariam até aqui, e aqui vai algumas:    1 - Minha equipe ficou em 2° lugar em um (o que me gerou um bom dinheiro de inicio).  2 - Sai da Eng. Elétrica na UEA para me dedicar integralmente a (e essa decisão, deve ter sido a mais importante, pois desisti da minha 1@ graduação com 18 anos).  3 - O IFAM abriu um PSS a parte (aceitando notas de ENEMs anteriores). E foi com isso que retornei a vida acadêmica.  4 - O me deu um espaço para ser (foram 6 meses acumulando bolsas para fazer esse setup) - e tive que fazer meu melhor para passar em alguns cursos (os 2 cursos de ! 😂🤣)    Beleza Carlitos, tu conquistou isso tudo, mas, e aí?! Quais os conselhos que tu podes me passar? Aqui vão alguns:    1. Vai ter momentos onde, você terá que fazer escolhas indesejáveis.  2. Vai ter momentos, que se a sorte sorrir pra você, a sua história pode mudar completamente (comigo foi o HackaThon e a aprovação no IFAM), então, esteja preparado para as oportunidades!  3. Estude, e estude muito!! Graças aos 2 anos de estudo prévio, minha vida no IFAM foi um pouco tranquila.  4. (Vai dar desânimo? Claro!); (Vai dar vontade de Desistir? Sim, e muito!!); (Vai ter moleza? Nenhum pouco!); Mas ... vale a pena o esforço e a dedicação? Sim, com toda a certeza!! ✌️    Dicas:    1. Quer se encontrar no universo da Programação? Pesquise qualquer área no Google, e pegue quanta informação quiser! Meta a cara! Participe de eventos, palestras, maratonas, cursos on-line; se exponha basicamente!  2. O Guanabara é um heroi para os iniciantes! Procure por ""Curso em Vídeo"" no YT.  3. Aprenda o quanto antes! Por 2 razões bem simples: (1)facilitará em muito seus ; (2)cedo ou tarde, você pode para uma gringa (e eu já recebi uma proposta dessas, mas não tinha como eu concorrer).    Acho que é isso!

336,"""Hey Kesavan, is there by any chance that I can join the upcoming Hack2Hire as mentor?""    Barely only 3 weeks into the job, I made the bold move to volunteer as mentor for the latest iteration of ' Virtual Hack2Hire event.    If you ask me why, it's because I got to where I am now literally because of this platform. The least I could do is go back and essentially give back to the community by using my experience to help others achieve the same dream as I did a year ago.    By pure chance, I got assigned to roughly the same mentees that I mentored during UMHackathon 2021, for the team Logos. Unlike that competition however, I can certainly say that mentors in Hack2Hire play an arguably even bigger role; not just in giving technical advices but also to motivate them to endure the pressure along the way.    The latter especially couldn't be more true and prominent for me. Not only that I convinced my assigned team to keep their chin up and restrategise despite being unable to develop a fully-functional MVP, but I even went out of my way to call and persuade my dear friend and his teammate to not call it quits due to unforeseen circumstances, and stepped in to accompany them for their presentation rehearsal despite not being their mentor.    I realised that since I was once in their shoes, that experience allows me to relate and empathise with them more.    While the past 2 days had been exhausting for me, seeing the faces of many especially my mentees and friends lit up when the results are announced made it all worthwhile.    Not only all of my Logos team members , , and managed to get the internship offers, but 's team Bit Legion was also among the special mentioned teams, to my delight.    Many congratulations as well to my FCSIT UM peers-turned-future-colleagues , , , and for getting the coveted permanent job offers!

Within 24 hours, me and my team developed a web-application, using React in frontend and MySQL and Express.js in backend, as a solution for the challenge.    Our application is designed to help volunteers at FunkyTown Food Project to learn and get information on different crops and how different tasks, such as sowing, watering, weeding, and harvesting work before choosing to do a task. It is also designed to provide tasks appropriately to each volunteer based on the volunteer's experience and weather predictions. In the application, volunteers can book a day and time and choose a task that is provided on each day.    This hackathon was an amazing experience, and I am glad to not only bond with my team and learn new frameworks and develop technical skills, but to also serve the community.

We decided to create an interactive web application that ""gameifys"" this in-person experience, where we incorporated different workshop pathways for users to take, implemented a streak system that keeps track of days accessed and provides rewards for a certain amounts of days on the app, and included a chatbot ""Costal Charlie"" to help users navigate to these different workshops.

Over 24 hours, my team brainstormed and produced a solution for a charity passionate about bees. This was particularly meaningful for me because I love nature and having understood the importance of bees in our ecosystems my team worked tirelessly over the next 24 hours to produce a web app that would educate and increase awareness of the importance of bees.    One of the biggest takeaways from the hackathon was learning to work with new technologies, applying empathy & accessibility in technology and new friends.

203,"Just recently I had the pleasure of participating in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Chicago Code For Good Hackathon; and as someone who’s only ever participated in one other hackathon, it really blew me away. I’m sure to some, the idea of coding for 24 hours straight sounds like a nightmare. But, while there were definitely struggles, the energy that everyone felt for those 24 hours was incredible. It was one of those, “you just have to have been there”, types of experiences.      For anyone trying to get their foot into the software world, I would absolutely recommend the Code For Good Hackathon. I’ve only participated in two hackathons now, but each time I do I feel like my knowledge rockets forward by months. The best way to learn is to do, and there’s no better place to do than a hackathon. For anybody that will soon be participating in one of the other Code For Good Hackathons or wants to participate next year, the best advice I can give is to collaborate! Our team worked closely together from start to finish and that is above and beyond, the reason we were able to win.     Finally, I just want to point out the charitable nature of the event. Often as professionals, we can get too caught up in what company we’re working for and how much money we’re making; and while I certainly won’t pretend that those don’t matter, events like these really shine a light on the good that technology can do for the world. I don’t think anybody wants to get to retirement having done very little good for the world at large. To aspiring software engineers Code For Good, is a great opportunity to learn and do good; and to current software engineers, I would encourage you to think about how you can use your skills to make a real difference.

Our application directly answers Jream's goals in two key ways:    First, JreamCloud enables Alumni and Students to register themselves and connect with other Alumni by location via our interactive map feature.    Second, JreamCloud provides a personalized donations tool that focuses on donation transparency. This feature targets Alumni retention by giving them a reason to stay connected with Jream.

2,"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place.    I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Godwinn W.    Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.    Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act.    The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.    Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me.    Special Thanks  Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon.

8,"The UNFPA Bangladesh Country Representative Kristine Blokus was being received in Camp 4 Hope Field Hospital-UKhiya by George Otieno the UNFPA-SRH Team Lead Cox's Bazar. The Visit took place on 25-8-2022 and was led by UNFPA Regional Director Bjorn Andersson. “The realities of humanitarian crises around the world and the need for multisectoral and innovative partnerships across all layers of society and the humanitarian community are visible here”said Kristine  Five years into the Rohingya people’s mass exodus to Bangladesh, caused by escalating violence and decades of marginalization, those who have sought refuge and normalcy continue to face great challenges, although their situation is more stable now.  Some traveled to Cox’s Bazar, currently the world’s largest refugee camp which houses close to one million Rohingya refugees. One would meet with Rohingya people, the host communities, the frontline workers including health care professionals and service providers and UNFPA’s partners, both governmental and civil society organizations. From these encounters and the good discussions One had with the community representatives and partners, one could witness how over the course of the last five years, everyone has come together to respond to the vast needs, including the refugees themselves who have endured immense trauma across generations.  From the onset of the crisis in 2017, UNFPA has established and gradually expanded programmes to respond to gender-based violence, provide sexual and reproductive health services, and empower and engage young people. Now there are 236 midwives who have received mentorship support and are putting those acquired skills into practice at both governmental and non-governmental health facilities. Women and girls are receiving lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services through 22 health facilities, 39 women- friendly spaces and 5 multi-purpose women centres which serve both Rohingya refugees and host communities. It was witnessed during the visit how effective referral between sexual and reproductive health, and gender- based violence response services helped to ensure that the needs of women and girls are met. At the UNFPA-supported Hope Field Hospital, we saw how midwives strive to ensure every mother delivers safely, despite complications that require urgent medical attention.  UNFPA is also strengthening the monitoring and surveillance of maternal mortality to ensure that the risks faced by women during pregnancy or childbirth are identified through joint approaches among the various humanitarian actors. We observed activities at a Women Led Community Centre, one of 10 such centres supported by UNFPA and our donors, and run by partners in Cox’s Bazar. The Centre supports women and girls through skills development and economic empowerment and is one important example stakeholders are coming together to fight gender-based violence, advance gender equality andwomen and girls in the Rohingya said Bjorn","Team Leader-Sexual, Reproductive Health and Rights Unit UNFPA, Cox’s Bazar & Coordinator SRH Working Group",UNFPA Bangladesh Country Representative Kristine Blokus wa received Camp Hope Field Hospital UKhiya George Otieno UNFPA SRH Team Lead Cox Bazar Visit took place wa led UNFPA Regional Director Bjorn Andersson reality humanitarian crisis around world need multisectoral innovative partnership across layer society humanitarian community visible said Kristine Five year Rohingya people mass exodus Bangladesh caused escalating violence decade marginalization sought refuge normalcy continue face great challenge although situation stable traveled Cox Bazar currently world largest refugee camp house close one million Rohingya refugee One would meet Rohingya people host community frontline worker including health care professional service provider UNFPA partner governmental civil society organization encounter good discussion One community representative partner one could witness course last five year everyone ha come together respond vast need including refugee endured immense trauma across generation onset crisis UNFPA ha established gradually expanded programme respond gender based violence provide sexual reproductive health service empower engage young people midwife received mentorship support putting acquired skill practice governmental non governmental health facility Women girl receiving lifesaving sexual reproductive health service health facility woman friendly space multi purpose woman centre serve Rohingya refugee host community wa witnessed visit effective referral sexual reproductive health gender based violence response service helped ensure need woman girl met UNFPA supported Hope Field Hospital saw midwife strive ensure every mother delivers safely despite complication require urgent medical attention UNFPA also strengthening monitoring surveillance maternal mortality ensure risk faced woman pregnancy childbirth identified joint approach among various humanitarian actor observed activity Women Led Community Centre one centre supported UNFPA donor run partner Cox Bazar Centre support woman girl skill development economic empowerment one important example stakeholder coming together fight gender based violence advance gender equality andwomen girl Rohingya said Bjorn

16,"Welcome to a new series of “My Journey at SalaryBox” where we talk with the team about how they got to SalaryBox, and what their stories have been.    Today we spoke with , a Software Engineer at our Gurgaon office, about what makes his work challenging and exciting.    📍What do you do at SalaryBox?  I’m a Software developer who joined the team in January 2022. I make sure that the web app and iOS interface used for millions of SalaryBox customers is up and running. We've redesigned the entire interface over the last couple of months, and also moved from Flutter to . This ensured that our customers have a great experience while using the product. I can see things improving as a result of my work, and that’s really satisfying.      📍How did you land in your current role?  I was a student of in Dehradun, and SalaryBox had come for campus placements. Funnily enough, I did not get selected after the final round. I was still very keen to join and reached out to the founders directly, to apply for an internship. The next thing I know that I was working with them a week later. Seeing my work, my internship was converted into a full-time role.   By joining SalaryBox I realized how much I value constant innovation and building new systems and tools. One of the coolest things about building new things is that it requires you to understand the vast scope of work, read and upskill yourself every day. It’s challenging, yet exciting work.    📍What’s a typical workday like for you?   Most of my day involves designing and building out the SalaryBox website app, so a lot of writing code and reading technical documentation ( and are lifesavers! ). I’d say I spend 15% of my time syncing with colleagues on updates for ongoing projects. I’m fortunate to have a variety of projects to work on — this helps me feel constantly challenged and motivated to work. Each morning we get together for an hour or so to discuss our weekly sprint goals. This allows us to make sure we’re on track as a team and to plan the rest of the week.  I feel like I have a great balance between collaborating and working independently.     📍What inspires you to come in every day?   It would be unfair not to mention all the amazing people I work with on a daily basis — my colleagues are a crucial part of the work I do. The support system here is incredible, and they guide me on how the current app is structured, and how new things can be added.  I've interacted with a lot of my friends, who are currently working at MNCs and other larger organizations. Sadly, they are yet to be allocated tasks and given core responsibilities. I, on the other hand, have been entrusted with multiple high-impact development items, and the ownership of my work really motivates me. Working at a startup has been a fantastic learning curve, and I've upskilled myself in multiple ways - that includes playing table tennis!","9,524 followers",Welcome new series Journey SalaryBox talk team got SalaryBox story Today spoke Software Engineer Gurgaon office make work challenging exciting SalaryBox Software developer joined team January make sure web app iOS interface used million SalaryBox customer running redesigned entire interface last couple month also moved Flutter ensured customer great experience using product see thing improving result work really satisfying land current role wa student Dehradun SalaryBox come campus placement Funnily enough get selected final round wa still keen join reached founder directly apply internship next thing know wa working week later Seeing work internship wa converted full time role joining SalaryBox realized much value constant innovation building new system tool One coolest thing building new thing requires understand vast scope work read upskill every day challenging yet exciting work typical workday like day involves designing building SalaryBox website app lot writing code reading technical documentation lifesaver say spend time syncing colleague update ongoing project fortunate variety project work help feel constantly challenged motivated work morning get together hour discus weekly sprint goal allows u make sure track team plan rest week feel like great balance collaborating working independently inspires come every day would unfair mention amazing people work daily basis colleague crucial part work support system incredible guide current app structured new thing added interacted lot friend currently working MNCs larger organization Sadly yet allocated task given core responsibility hand entrusted multiple high impact development item ownership work really motivates Working startup ha fantastic learning curve upskilled multiple way includes playing table tennis

19,"Blue Ocean Innovation 2022 🌊⚓️    The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 14 is to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources.”    To achieve this, it is important to support the blue economy encouraging sustainable start-up companies, innovators and innovations that can scale to solve the ocean’s grand challenges.     1️⃣) Plant-based fish and seafood products🐟    Plant-based innovation is one of the biggest and most exciting growth areas in the food industry today, and while meat substitutes are the fastest growing sub-category in this market (an increase of 152 percent in 2019), fish and shellfish alternatives are now poised for dynamic growth.    Investment in alternative fish and seafood startups has been brisk, with new companies and products starting to expand the market.    2️⃣) Reversing the plastics crisis🧴    Plastics are useful. They're used to help make lifesaving medical supplies, lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts, and insulation for our homes. But nearly half of all plastic produced goes towards single-use items such as bags, straws, utensils and takeout containers.     There's a number of companies trying to develop cost-efficient and eco-friendly substitutes, from mushroom packaging to advanced fibers and plastic-free online shopping.     3️⃣) Ocean-based renewable energies⚡️    Rapid transformation of our energy systems is required if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit the global average temperature rise. In addition to expanding land-based renewable energy, the ocean offers significant potential for supporting this transition.    However, new technologies must be implemented in a sustainable way in order to avoid unintended consequences that could undermine other aspects of ocean health.

20,"Today, more than 20 months since India and South Africa first proposed a landmark intellectual property (IP) Waiver for #COVID19 medical tools at the World Trade Organization (WTO), governments have reached a decision. Dr. Christos Christou, International President of MSF shares his thoughts:    “We are disappointed with the inadequate outcome on waiving intellectual property for COVID-19 medical tools that resulted from more than 20 months of deliberations.    We acknowledge that a few changes were made to the agreement that mitigated some of the most worrisome elements of the earlier text presented in May 2022, but overall, we are disappointed that a true intellectual property waiver, proposed in October 2020 covering all COVID-19 medical tools and including all countries, could not be agreed, even during a pandemic that has claimed more than 15 million people’s lives.    This agreement fails overall to offer an effective and meaningful solution to help increase people’s access to needed medical tools during the pandemic, as it does not adequately waive intellectual property on all essential COVID-19 medical tools, and it does not apply to all countries. The measures outlined in the decision will not address pharmaceutical monopolies or ensure affordable access to lifesaving medical tools and will set a negative precedent for future global health crises and pandemics.    Throughout the pandemic, MSF has repeatedly pointed out the challenges and struggles faced by frontline healthcare workers in providing care for people facing COVID-19. Despite lofty political commitments and words of solidarity, it has been discouraging for us to see that wealthy countries failed to resolve the glaring inequities in access to lifesaving COVID-19 medical tools for people in low- and middle-income countries.    Without agreement on a true global solution to ongoing access challenges, MSF now urges governments to take immediate steps at the national level to make sure people have access to needed COVID-19 medical tools. Governments should consider using all available legal and policy options, including suspending intellectual property on COVID-19 medical tools, issuing compulsory licenses on key medical technologies to overcome patent barriers, and adopting new laws and policies to ensure the disclosure of essential technical information needed to support generic production and supply.    MSF also calls on governments to take concrete steps to rethink and reform the biomedical innovation system to ensure that lifesaving medical tools are developed, produced and supplied equitably where monopoly-based and market-driven principles are not a barrier to access. It is time to prioritize saving lives instead of protecting corporate and political interests.”","68,030 followers",Today month since India South Africa first proposed landmark intellectual property IP Waiver COVID medical tool World Trade Organization WTO government reached decision Dr Christos Christou International President MSF share thought disappointed inadequate outcome waiving intellectual property COVID medical tool resulted month deliberation acknowledge change made agreement mitigated worrisome element earlier text presented May overall disappointed true intellectual property waiver proposed October covering COVID medical tool including country could agreed even pandemic ha claimed million people life agreement fails overall offer effective meaningful solution help increase people access needed medical tool pandemic doe adequately waive intellectual property essential COVID medical tool doe apply country measure outlined decision address pharmaceutical monopoly ensure affordable access lifesaving medical tool set negative precedent future global health crisis pandemic Throughout pandemic MSF ha repeatedly pointed challenge struggle faced frontline healthcare worker providing care people facing COVID Despite lofty political commitment word solidarity ha discouraging u see wealthy country failed resolve glaring inequity access lifesaving COVID medical tool people low middle income country Without agreement true global solution ongoing access challenge MSF urge government take immediate step national level make sure people access needed COVID medical tool Governments consider using available legal policy option including suspending intellectual property COVID medical tool issuing compulsory license key medical technology overcome patent barrier adopting new law policy ensure disclosure essential technical information needed support generic production supply MSF also call government take concrete step rethink reform biomedical innovation system ensure lifesaving medical tool developed produced supplied equitably monopoly based market driven principle barrier access time prioritize saving life instead protecting corporate political interest
21,"On 19 July 2022, CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program interns, Azarely, Manjari, and I had an illuminating interview with Paula Padrino Vilela, an expert in the field of disaster management who worked for international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), NATO, and the UN Environment Program (UNEP) to help prevent and mitigate the effects of disasters on human life. She is currently the project coordinator of UNEP and is working to bring emerging technologies including fields like artificial intelligence, robotics, drones, and the Internet of Things (IOT) to the forefront of disaster response to more effectively prevent damage and save lives.     Paula related her insight into the rapidly changing world we live in. The effects of climate change only serve to accelerate the damage and death tolls incurred by disasters worldwide, but technology is also developing at an ever-quickening pace, allowing for new avenues to fight disasters every day. She sees artificial intelligence as the main technology that will allow for effective disaster prevention, while innovations in the fields of robotics, autonomous vehicles and IOT support the revolutionary power of AI. For example, robots and drones use AI for navigation and making autonomous decisions in the field, while the advent of the IoT lets widely distributed sensor suites feed data into a large data set to further improve upon and gain results from AI.      She also shared some of the challenges that least developed and developing countries face while working on disaster prevention and mitigation. These countries are often the most harshly impacted by climate change and its associated environmental effects, but have the least funds available for which to deal with them. Instead of pursuing the most cutting-edge technologies that first-world countries often do, they invest in simpler, proven, and durable means by which to detect and prevent disasters, which is something that must be kept in mind in order to make these lifesaving products accessible to all who require it.     Our interview with Paula helped us glean much insight into the field of disaster management worldwide, not just in the United States where we live. We hope to apply this knowledge in our work and beyond as the world grapples with a warming environment and an increasing frequency of disasters.",Systems Lead at Space Technologies and Rocketry,July CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program intern Azarely Manjari illuminating interview Paula Padrino Vilela expert field disaster management worked international organization including International Committee Red Cross ICRC NATO UN Environment Program UNEP help prevent mitigate effect disaster human life currently project coordinator UNEP working bring emerging technology including field like artificial intelligence robotics drone Internet Things IOT forefront disaster response effectively prevent damage save life Paula related insight rapidly changing world live effect climate change serve accelerate damage death toll incurred disaster worldwide technology also developing ever quickening pace allowing new avenue fight disaster every day see artificial intelligence main technology allow effective disaster prevention innovation field robotics autonomous vehicle IOT support revolutionary power AI example robot drone use AI navigation making autonomous decision field advent IoT let widely distributed sensor suite feed data large data set improve upon gain result AI also shared challenge least developed developing country face working disaster prevention mitigation country often harshly impacted climate change associated environmental effect least fund available deal Instead pursuing cutting edge technology first world country often invest simpler proven durable mean detect prevent disaster something must kept mind order make lifesaving product accessible require interview Paula helped u glean much insight field disaster management worldwide United States live hope apply knowledge work beyond world grapple warming environment increasing frequency disaster

If you are interested here are some extracts and the full copy is below in link 🙏     🔹Globalisation was not just about trading commodities on large ships. In the digital age, it's about sharing something far more powerful - ideas - on the internet. Whilst commodities are physical, ideas are intangible. So Trust has an even bigger role to play.     🔹When you place a digital lens over history, an unfortunate dovetail emerges. When the Cold War officially ended in the early 1990s, it was replaced with the beginning of the cyber war. Back then cyber was just starting to warm up - now it is dangerously simmering.      🔹Many people are uncomfortable that a Government would refer to people as ‘Customers’ as opposed to ‘Citizens’. The rationale is simple. Govt provide services to refugees, visa holders and tourists - who are not citizens.      Customer is an inclusive term, which means everybody is entitled to quality service delivery - citizens and refugees alike.      🔹We can use digital to empower the individual, build more Trust and therefore strengthen our precious democracy.     There is no other way forward. A trustless world, is a world of ever diminishing tribes.","Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Fair Trading at NSW Government & Member for Ryde",Yesterday gave speech Australian Financial Review Government Services Summit interested extract full copy link Globalisation wa trading commodity large ship digital age sharing something far powerful idea internet Whilst commodity physical idea intangible Trust ha even bigger role play place digital lens history unfortunate dovetail emerges Cold War officially ended early wa replaced beginning cyber war Back cyber wa starting warm dangerously simmering Many people uncomfortable Government would refer people Customers opposed Citizens rationale simple Govt provide service refugee visa holder tourist citizen Customer inclusive term mean everybody entitled quality service delivery citizen refugee alike use digital empower individual build Trust therefore strengthen precious democracy way forward trustless world world ever diminishing tribe

This included clearing up some storage space on my laptop (the red bar has been haunting me for a while) as well as gathering evidence as part of my off-the-job training.    20% of my apprenticeship is off-the-job training, which could be university lectures, research, workplace mentoring , shadowing, or workshops!    I have an off-the-job training log where I note these activities and link photo and video evidence to show that I've done them!

39,"So thrilled to share that my team presented our hackathon project to the exec panel (Ime Archibong, Andrew Bosworth, Roy Austin, Chris Cox, Vishu Gupta) at Meta yesterday! Our work was one of the 8 presented projects, picked from 350+ projects by over 1400 hackers as part of the 2022 Global .    Counterintuitively, I find hackathon a great tool to fight burnout, for many reasons:  1. unleashing creativity.  2. forcing me to think outside of my day-to-day work  3. empowering me to wear different hats. At most times, I’m a Product Designer. This time I tried product management, product design and branding altogether.   4. working with people I always want to work with. (A huge thank you to my incredible team and for hacking with me)  5. low opportunity cost even if the idea failed. Much lower cost than failing my own startup if, say, I kick start an immature idea.  6. bonus: sometimes you might get lucky to pitch to execs.   7. finally and most importantly, it's such fun to work on an idea a whole team is passionate about!

41,"Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Unity and others form Metaverse Standards Forum    As more tech companies develop virtual and augmented reality products, some oversight groups are trying to keep the industry on the same page. The newest of these is the Metaverse Standards Forum, which aims to drive open interoperability, which could make it easier for developers to build across platforms.    As announced today, the forum already has some major players on board, such as Meta, Microsoft, Epic Games, Adobe, NVIDiA, Sony, Unity and others. But there are also some glaring absences, including companies like Niantic, Apple, Roblox and Snapchat, which are building consumer “metaverse” products as well.    The Metaverse Standards Forum is free to join and plans to focus on “pragmatic, action-based projects” like hackathons and open source tooling.    “There won’t be a Meta-run metaverse, just as there isn’t a ‘Microsoft internet’ or ‘Google internet’ today,” explained Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg in a blog post last month. “Like the internet, the metaverse will be an interconnected system that transcends national borders, so there will need to be a web of public and private standards, norms and rules to allow for it to operate across jurisdictions.”    Consortiums like these are only effective if enough companies adopt their standards, though.    Tiffany Xingyu Wang, chief security officer at AI content moderation company Spectrum Labs, launched the Oasis Consortium earlier this year. In an effort to promote greater commitments to safety from gaming and social companies, the Oasis Consortium developed a list of user safety standards, which it hopes will become an industry standard.    “If the metaverse is going to survive, it has to have safety in it,” Wang told the Technology Review.    Content moderation is especially tricky in virtual reality, when online harassment or abuse can feel even more frightening due to the immersive nature of the technology. And in some cases, it seems like companies are prioritizing product development over robust safety tools.    Similar to the Metaverse Standards Forum, some key players are missing from the Oasis Consortium, like Meta. And in the past, groups like this have become smaller and smaller once internal conflict inevitably arises.    The Metaverse Standards Forum is led by the Khronos Group, a nonprofit consortium working on AR/VR, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more. Khronos has already tried to set a standard for VR APIs with its similarly named VR Standards Initiative in 2016, which included companies like Google, NVIDIA. Epic Games and Oculus, which is now part of Meta.

45,"Hard to believe: today was our first in-person narrative training in 2.5 years!    Thrilled to spend it with our friends at Meta in SF, co-facilitating the day with the brilliant elfin . While working with one of Meta’s smartest, hardest working global partnerships teams.    Next week, it’s a couple trainings for UX designers for an AI org and a Product Summit within the Search org, hosted at MTV/Google HQ.    Early June, it’s a keynote for a Series C’s biannual hackathon, a workshop for data science, and a training for Google’s UX leaders. Followed by a keynote in Montreal, for a startup that’s scaling from product to platform.    It might sound like a lot. But honestly, it’s the speed of the game that I thrive at the most. Working at the highest level of stakes, influence and complexity. And getting a chance to test all of our newest teachings to very discerning and hard to please audiences. Sharing discourse and methods for leading with heart and conviction. And doing it in-person. Where you can literally see and feel the paradigm shift in the room and the bigger narrative come to life.

46,"An amazing global hackathon wrapped up yesterday, by/for the Knowledge Management community in a hybrid brainstorming session. Here are my Top 10 Takeaways!       1. The case for structure: busy professionals are all for ideation sessions, but structured flow and workspaces matter to keep things focused and on-time.  2. The case for messiness: there will be disagreements, differences in perspectives, and tech glitches – but that is part of the ideation journey as well.  3. The case for tools: Zoom and Google Docs are great, and newer platforms like Miro take virtual collaboration to another level. Tools will be key in the hybrid era.  4. Space for humour: jokes, mistakes and gaffes will be there aplenty, enjoy them! By mistake, people may join the wrong room, over-write others’ text, forget to un/mute mikes – laugh it off.  5. The need for leadership: Leaders who take inputs, build consensus, find sponsors, inspire communities, and unblock activities can drive knowledge collaboration.  6. The need for volunteers: The lion’s share of open community work is driven by volunteers, who rise above the occasion and catalyse participation. Worship them!  7. The power of design and design thinking: Understanding journey maps, problem space, ideation space, preto/prototyping, and stakeholder empathy are key for knowledge work.  8. The envelope of creativity: Creativity in the form of innovative designs, quirky mottos, energising games, icebreakers, and metaphorical photographs, can be thought-provoking and inspirational.  9. The in/visible hand: culture. Without a culture of humility, respect, curiosity, excellence, openness, safety, and commitment, knowledge cultures cannot succeed and scale.  10. The joy of discovery: As ideas are posted on sticky notes, clusters arise, ‘meta-knowledge’ emerges, and a new wave of ideas is triggered off – in cumulative spirals.    More lessons and takeaways will be shared in the coming days. For more such excitement and insights, join the today! Hats off to the whole team ...

The Metaverse Standards Forum is free to join and plans to focus on “pragmatic, action-based projects” like hackathons and open source tooling.    “There won’t be a Meta-run metaverse, just as there isn’t a ‘Microsoft internet’ or ‘Google internet’ today,” explained Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg in a blog post last month. “Like the internet, the metaverse will be an interconnected system that transcends national borders, so there will need to be a web of public and private standards, norms and rules to allow for it to operate across jurisdictions.”    Consortiums like these are only effective if enough companies adopt their standards, though.    Tiffany Xingyu Wang, chief security officer at AI content moderation company Spectrum Labs, launched the Oasis Consortium earlier this year. In an effort to promote greater commitments to safety from gaming and social companies, the Oasis Consortium developed a list of user safety standards, which it hopes will become an industry standard.    “If the metaverse is going to survive, it has to have safety in it,” Wang told the Technology Review.    Content moderation is especially tricky in virtual reality, when online harassment or abuse can feel even more frightening due to the immersive nature of the technology. And in some cases, it seems like companies are prioritizing product development over robust safety tools.    Similar to the Metaverse Standards Forum, some key players are missing from the Oasis Consortium, like Meta. And in the past, groups like this have become smaller and smaller once internal conflict inevitably arises.    The Metaverse Standards Forum is led by the Khronos Group, a nonprofit consortium working on AR/VR, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more. Khronos has already tried to set a standard for VR APIs with its similarly named VR Standards Initiative in 2016, which included companies like Google, NVIDIA. Epic Games and Oculus, which is now part of Meta.

51,"Super grateful to be the recipient for the Creating Impact Global Performance Spotlight at the February 2022 Global Field Programmer by Meta. I am beyond excited and honored to be featured as only 1 individual out of the Reality Labs Global Field Community receive this recognition every month. It's always a great feeling to represent a company where you feel valued and appreciated and where creativity is welcomed.    We were tasked a Field Mission for our Hackathon Field Contest Period 5 for 2 weeks in December to interview Retail Sales Associates and ask them, ""What is your favorite accessory to sell and why?"" After filming my first video with a Best Buy PC Associate. I noticed something was lacking as there wasn't enough spark on the video.    After one sleepless night, I totally remembered my time when I was a Substitute Teacher during 2018-2020. I remembered one day substitute teaching at a Junior High School where the students felt defeated, had no energy, and lacked enthusiasm. I then took inspiration to one of the most charismatic and energetic Game Show Host, with Family Feud. I ordered a Golden Microphone prop on Ebay and conducted Classroom like it was a Game Show and the students were participants. Surprisingly, the effect turned out well as classroom participation and engagement rapidly increased and students were live, animated, and jolly again. I remember leaving class and one of the students thanked me for trying and it feels great to feel appreciated to know I made a difference in someone's life.    Fast forward to now, I then took the same approach and it turned out to be a success once again. I ordered multiple Microphone props but this time customized it with Meta, Oculus, and Ray Ban Stories logo to make it look official using cardboard boxes. The creative microphones added that final touch on conducting interviews/testimonials with my Brand Influencers, Retail Sales Associates at /, and customers at Best Buy/ Pop Up Stores as well as formal trainings at (Ray Ban Stores). Many individuals loved the creativity and outside the box thinking as customer interactions and employee engagements felt more natural, fun, and real. It was such a huge success that there was a spin off and the bar was raised even higher in creativity when I introduced the Meta Boxing Gloves Gen 1 for 2 special interviews.    I’m excited for this new year as I’ll have the opportunity of showcasing more creativity and BIG ideas that allow me to contribute to and the Reality Labs Global Field Community. I am extremely grateful to be part of a great organization and I enjoy taking on assignments and goals that allow me to contribute to this company.",Tech Enthusiast - Collaborative Creative Content Creator - Charismatic Leader - Energetic Sales & Field Marketer - Empathetic Manager,Super grateful recipient Creating Impact Global Performance Spotlight February Global Field Programmer Meta beyond excited honored featured individual Reality Labs Global Field Community receive recognition every month always great feeling represent company feel valued appreciated creativity welcomed tasked Field Mission Hackathon Field Contest Period week December interview Retail Sales Associates ask favorite accessory sell filming first video Best Buy PC Associate noticed something wa lacking enough spark video one sleepless night totally remembered time wa Substitute Teacher remembered one day substitute teaching Junior High School student felt defeated energy lacked enthusiasm took inspiration one charismatic energetic Game Show Host Family Feud ordered Golden Microphone prop Ebay conducted Classroom like wa Game Show student participant Surprisingly effect turned well classroom participation engagement rapidly increased student live animated jolly remember leaving class one student thanked trying feel great feel appreciated know made difference someone life Fast forward took approach turned success ordered multiple Microphone prop time customized Meta Oculus Ray Ban Stories logo make look official using cardboard box creative microphone added final touch conducting interview testimonial Brand Influencers Retail Sales Associates customer Best Buy Pop Stores well formal training Ray Ban Stores Many individual loved creativity outside box thinking customer interaction employee engagement felt natural fun real wa huge success wa spin bar wa raised even higher creativity introduced Meta Boxing Gloves Gen special interview excited new year opportunity showcasing creativity BIG idea allow contribute Reality Labs Global Field Community extremely grateful part great organization enjoy taking assignment goal allow contribute company

53,"A few weeks ago, our marcom team at WhereIsMyTransport interviewed Danielle J. Harris for a white paper. Danielle shared some powerful insights about investing with impact in emerging markets, but this struck a chord with me:    “The value is not just the fixed data sets. When you marry data sets with other data sets, you unlock their true power.”    Inspired by this, I reached out to at .

64,"Yesterday, the 18th of September, I had an opportunity to experience a mix of positive feelings, from the nostalgia of participating in tech events and my career's initial years to the happiness of the moment and great hope for the future.    Before diving into a Developer and Leader path, I started my career as a Software Tester, which provided a strong foundation for the professional I am.    A little bit of background is that I used to do some extra work at a platform named Global App Testing, basically outsourcing my testing skills. Around 2017, already working at IBM and amid the hackathon and meetup fever, I received an invite to participate in an event called Testathon. It was a one-day event, which you can picture as a Hackathon for testers. Long story short: It was awesome and positively impacted my career.     Here we are today after a difficult period for the whole world, and I gladly received an invitation to the third Sao Paulo edition of the same event. I currently lead a squad focused on web solutions within IBM, and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to extend the invite to my peers.    The event's purpose perfectly matched our moment as a squad, as we are looking for ways to improve our testing capabilities.

Things were already great considering the event as a whole and the lovely book I got as a gift from my friend Ronald, but the cherry on top was winning the prize for the best quality bug report and seeing my friend Allan bring home one for the best QA team with the folks he met there.

67,"𝑺𝒊𝒄 𝑷𝒂𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒔 𝑴𝒂𝒈𝒏𝒂: ""There must be a beginning to any great matter, but continuing unto the end until it is thoroughly finished yields the true glory"" (Drake, 1587).    From a student whose ultimate goal was to graduate without his family spending a single centavo on tuition fees to a trailblazer finishing the race with flying colors, college taught me that when you fix your eyes on the process rather than outcomes, you can achieve more than and bigger than you thought possible.    Today, my heart is full seeing how far I've come. This is to honor the struggles that brought me here — the trials that weathered me into a warrior brave enough to face tomorrow.    It’s been a rough road and words can't describe how grateful I am to the Almighty God, to UA&P, to my ever-supportive family, friends (esp.

We were also told to chat with someone from our local team or across the Global Community and to be creative :) This Hackathon Field Contest which eventually turned into a passion project of mine received outstanding feedback from the Meta Team directly as well as it’s Global Partners. This Creative and Collaborative Project made the Reality Labs Team vision come true when they built the Global Community with other 3rd Party Labor Agencies representing Meta and I just wanted to share it with everyone as I am very proud of this project.    When I first received this project, I immediately thought how can I make this the most impactful and creative way being a Global Team. After brainstorming ideas, I reached out to each Global Partner , , , and asked if they could send me a video asking me, “What are some of my sales best practices?” Then, I wanted to answer that question while highlighting each specific country in an innovative way using the Portal Go. Fortunately, I already visited United Kingdom, France 2x, Spain, and had content/photos that I’m able to utilize for this passion project leaving Japan by itself since I still have not been there yet. Without having been to Japan, I decided to take a trip to Little Tokyo in Los Angeles and immerse myself within the language and environment. Being in the Japanese environment, I was able to learn quickly the basic introduction and greetings in Japanese and even implemented those as well for Team Japan’s segment.    For Team USA’s segment, I kept it simple with Having the 3 C’s which have totally helped me not only in sales, career, and school but also in relationships. To close the video with a bang, I dug in deep with the production value by wearing an international multiple flag jacket unifying all countries involved in the Global Field Team as well as holding the Belt signifying success with a sincere Thank You speech with Meta’s Mission Statement. To end this post, I want to thank all the Global Partners and people that helped me contribute for this video , , , , and making Meta Labs Reality dream and vision come true.

95,"Women in Tech    For a long time, the African girl lacked notable figures to look up to, especially in the technology field. Back in the day, girls could hardly mention the name of any lady they would love to emulate should they take a career path in tech in the future. The lack of female role models and mentors in Africa greatly reinforced the perception that careers in tech are generally for men and not women.    women are generally less likely to take a career path in tech and other STEM fields(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) while in school. A study by UNESCO reveals that women constitute 28% of STEM students in sub-Saharan Africa, this is below the global average of 30%, a situation that has for a long time widened the gender gap. Women's participation in STEM subjects drops progressively moving up the education and career ladder.    African women in the tech industry are also subjected to some level of bias in the roles assigned to them. Despite having technical skills and qualifications, women are still pushed towards roles that are perceived to be non-technical, mostly touching on execution while their male counterparts perform technical roles.    Women in tech, especially in Africa are subjected to low hiring rates, less pay and are often overlooked in promotions. Global statistics reveal that 39% of women view gender bias as the primary reason for not being offered a promotion. Equality decreases with the rise in seniority as far as women are concerned. A study by Entello reveals that women account for 19% of tech roles. At the senior level, the percentage drops to 16%, and at the executive level, only 10% of roles in tech are held by women.    Their contribution, efforts and achievements are often overlooked. Despite being the brains behind some of the world's notable technological advancements and achievements, women's contribution is unrecognised on many occasions with men taking credit for some of the success achieved by women.    Recent efforts to empower women in technology seem to bear fruits. compared to the past, there is now increased visibility of female role models in the tech space. Furthermore, there is also increased access to tech career opportunities for women.    The Emergence of all-female boot camps, incubators, accelerators, hackathons and grants in Africa is a “game changer” in the African tech ecosystem. Initiatives such as this have accelerated female inclusivity in the tech space by providing opportunities for women to close the gap that currently exists in the tech space.    Women now also are given senior positions in big tech companies. Recently Microsoft engineering hub in Nairobi appointed Catherine Muraga as a managing director. Rosemary Kimwatu was appointed by as a data protection officer. Faith Gitonga is also a director at .

144,"Agora em outubro, tive o prazer de acompanhar um projeto muito especial, o e-Waste, para gestão de resíduos de forma sustentável, durante o MICROSOFT GLOBAL HACKATHON 2021.    Essa iniciativa seguiu o formato de um hackathon online, com a , , , , , , , , e Lucas de Lima. Super projeto de impacto sustentável, com diversas ações previstas para breve, aguarde! Parabéns para todo o time desde já!    Hoje, SUSTENTABILIDADE é um tema crescente, amplo e complexo, envolvendo ÁGUA, ENERGIA, TRATAMENTO DE RESÍDUOS e PESSOAS, em estratégias de ESG - Environmental, Social and corporate Governance.    Até 2019, a saúde planetária já era um desafio, com números crescentes de atenção e cuidado. No pós-pandemia, esses desafios serão ainda maiores, com o aumento de desigualdades e necessidade de atuação mais forte sobre recuperação de rendas, adoção de economia circular, eliminação da pobreza extrema, tendências de reuso, produção sustentável, inclusão social, tratamento de resíduos, ações para a diversidade, impacto ambiental e responsabilidade social. E hoje no Brasil, revivemos desafios conhecidos como seca, crise hídrica, crise energética, aumento de desigualdades.     Em alguns dias, a COP26 (conferência do clima em Glasgow, na Escócia) terá início, de 31 de outubro a 12 de novembro e já é considerada crucial para a revisão de ações e metas para o controle e redução do impacto com as mudanças climáticas. A Terra está ficando mais quente, continuamos com termoelétricas, continuamos queimando derivados de petróleo, usamos pouco matrizes renováveis de energia como eólicas ou solar, oceanos estão mais plásticos, a degradação de biomas é crescente, geleiras derretem, para citar alguns desafios que serão temas para debates.     A dica é acompanhar o que será discutido na COP26 em alguns dias, quais compromissos serão firmados, como cada país irá se posicionar nessa jornada e o impacto para cada um de nós de forma prática, a partir de 2022 e até 2030.         A década que começou com o desafio da pandemia e da saúde da humanidade, deve seguir com o desafio da sustentabilidade e da saúde planetária.

Gitcoin est une plateforme où des développeurs peuvent être payé pour travailler sur des projets open source en liaison avec Web3. Il est aussi possible de participer à des hackathons avec des entreprises partenaires comme j'ai pu le faire et d'être récompensé en .    L'hackathon lancé par l'entreprise avait pour challenge d'intégrer leur fonctionnalité de login au sein d'une Dapp.    Cet forme de login permet à l'utilisateur de se connecter facilement sur une application sans avoir à renseigner de mot de passe et juste en mettant en lien au final son adresse de portefeuille (pensez sorte de compte bancaire pour crypto monnaies). Mais son utilisation va plus loin en permettant aussi de récupérer des méta-données qui seraient liés à cette adresse, comme une adresse mail ou nom d'utilisateur, ce qui permettrait de ne pas avoir à gérer et collecter ce genre d'information sur sa propre application.    Ayant déjà ma propre Dapp à un stage assez avancé, notamment pour la connexion de portefeuille, j'ai décidé de démarrer un nouveau projet et me suis lancé dans le challenge. Quelques problèmes d'intégration sont arrivés mais globalement l'expérience fut bonne et m'a permis d'en apprendre plus sur un nouveau moyen de connexion qui permet globalement une meilleure expérience utilisateur.  Challenge terminé, 50 participants, dont moi même, ont été récompensé.

You have to manage two different strategic logics, two different strategy processes, two different political dynamics that come with being in both worlds.    I like to call this ability – the second capability of our framework for business ecosystem leadership, on which I take a closer look in this edition of my newsletter.    There are five important questions companies must answer with confidence if they want to master the dual nature of ecosystem strategy:    -  Who are we?  -  Why do we participate?  -  What do we contribute?  -  Are we ready?  -  How do we compete?

10,"I am honoured to announce that, along with my excellent team SEAT members (Shenyi Cui Aaron K. Terence Poh), we placed 1st amongst 110 other teams across the world in the annual Singapore Airlines AppChallenge 2022 (Tertiary Track).    Our project used TensorFlow Recommenders A.I., which takes into account user profiles and preferences to recommend activities, accommodations and other ancillary services to users post flight booking. We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).    As a Business Analyst, my deep dive into the aviation and tourism industry was an exciting opportunity to garner new insights. In such a competitive landscape, identifying key challenges and assessing viable pipelines led to developing a robust strategy that complemented the team's direction and solution. Throughout the process, we continuously reevaluated our approach which eventually took shape as we considered realistic and essential aspects to ensure the success of our project.    It was an arduous yet enriching journey for the team. We worked many late nights, juggling the new school term while handling the project - all towards the goal of producing our best work. I am incredibly fortunate to learn a lot from my teammates and other finalists. If given the opportunity, the team and I are looking forward in furthering the development of the product.

12,"I am honoured to announce that this summer (24/7/22 – 28/8/22), along with my outstanding team SEAT members (Shenyi Cui Emmanuel Ang Terence Poh), placed 1st amongst 110 other teams across the world in the Singapore Airlines AppChallenge 2022 (Tertiary Track).    Our project used TensorFlow Recommenders A.I., which considers user-profiles and preferences to recommend activities, accommodations and other ancillary services to users post flight booking. We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).    As a U.I. designer and developer on the team, I experimented with new workflows, such as focusing on producing a feasible design early on before handing it over for development. The new workflow significantly reduces the time needed to develop the minimal viable product (MVP). Aside from that, I designed and deployed a Flask application to process the data and serve as an API to handle communication between TensorFlow Recommenders and our front-facing web application.    It was an arduous yet fulfilling journey for my team and I. We worked many late nights, juggling school and the project, hoping to produce our best work. I managed to learn from my teammates and other finalists. I am thrilled to have participated and given my all. If given the opportunity, my team and I look forward to furthering the development of the product.    Thanks to and for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to for increasing the team’s potential through his exceptional mentorship and guidance during the final two weeks of the hackathon.",Undergraduate in Information Systems | Aspiring Full Stack Developer,honoured announce summer along outstanding team SEAT member Shenyi Cui Emmanuel Ang Terence Poh placed st amongst team across world Singapore Airlines AppChallenge Tertiary Track project used TensorFlow Recommenders considers user profile preference recommend activity accommodation ancillary service user post flight booking aimed leverage recommendation system create stickier ecosystem ultimately increase revenue stream Singapore Airlines Group solution wa served directly user friendly Progressive Web Application PWA U designer developer team experimented new workflow focusing producing feasible design early handing development new workflow significantly reduces time needed develop minimal viable product MVP Aside designed deployed Flask application process data serve API handle communication TensorFlow Recommenders front facing web application wa arduous yet fulfilling journey team worked many late night juggling school project hoping produce best work managed learn teammate finalist thrilled participated given given opportunity team look forward furthering development product Thanks organising hackathon Special shoutout increasing team potential exceptional mentorship guidance final two week hackathon
