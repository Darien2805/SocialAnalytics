       " {'Post Text': \"Over two weeks in August, my team took part in the Accenture University Innovation Challenge 2022, where we were challenged to come up with innovative solutions to accelerate the adoption of EVs in Singapore. I’m delighted to share that we were selected to be one of the 6 teams in the Finals, out of the 91 teams that participated in this Challenge. For two weeks, my team researched and came up with all sorts of awesome ideas, from wireless charging to EV leasing, and we even wrangled with a huge concept of smart cities and logistics at some point. Finally, we decided to pursue a platform that provides real-time, accurate data on EV charging locations for consumers, as well as analytics for EV-related data that are collected from our platform. It brought together relevant stakeholders, such as the government, private companies, as well as consumers, and we projected to increase the EV uptake in Singapore by 30%! We saw potential in analysing such data for REITs in future as well, as research showed a correlation between EV charging stations and retail traffic in shopping malls.I would like to thank:Our mentor Michael (Mike) Sweeney, who shared his own interesting experiences and insights about the EV industry and stakeholders to us. My teammates: Ezekiel Woo, Ethan Khor, Ming Han Lee, Jun Hong Au-Yong, for the amazing job while we were all juggling full-time internships during this challenge. Accenture and staff for the hard work organising this challenge, and entertaining our weird requests; emailing Peiwen Pan the photoshopped team image because our full team couldn't make it And last but not least, the people I met during the challenge: including my SUSS comrades Titus Tan and Li Yang Suet; my (CHAMPION) bro Ryon Teo who I met after a very long time; and Joseph Ong for chilling with us after the sessions!There are many more I did not mention, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet everyone during this challenge.

       " {'Post Text': \"Over two weeks in August, my team took part in the Accenture University Innovation Challenge 2022, where we were challenged to come up with innovative solutions to accelerate the adoption of EVs in Singapore. I’m delighted to share that we were selected to be one of the 6 teams in the Finals, out of the 91 teams that participated in this Challenge. For two weeks, my team researched and came up with all sorts of awesome ideas, from wireless charging to EV leasing, and we even wrangled with a huge concept of smart cities and logistics at some point. Finally, we decided to pursue a platform that provides real-time, accurate data on EV charging locations for consumers, as well as analytics for EV-related data that are collected from our platform. It brought together relevant stakeholders, such as the government, private companies, as well as consumers, and we projected to increase the EV uptake in Singapore by 30%! We saw potential in analysing such data for REITs in future as well, as research showed a correlation between EV charging stations and retail traffic in shopping malls.I would like to thank:Our mentor Michael (Mike) Sweeney, who shared his own interesting experiences and insights about the EV industry and stakeholders to us. My teammates: Ezekiel Woo, Ethan Khor, Ming Han Lee, Jun Hong Au-Yong, for the amazing job while we were all juggling full-time internships during this challenge. Accenture and staff for the hard work organising this challenge, and entertaining our weird requests; emailing Peiwen Pan the photoshopped team image because our full team couldn't make it And last but not least, the people I met during the challenge: including my SUSS comrades Titus Tan and Li Yang Suet; my (CHAMPION) bro Ryon Teo who I met after a very long time; and Joseph Ong for chilling with us after the sessions!There are many more I did not mention, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet everyone during this challenge. Looking forward to connect more in future!#ACNUniInnoChallenge\\n…see more\",\n",

I’m delighted to share that we were selected to be one of the 6 teams in the Finals, out of the 91 teams that participated in this Challenge.    For two weeks, my team researched and came up with all sorts of awesome ideas, from wireless charging to EV leasing, and we even wrangled with a huge concept of smart cities and logistics at some point. Finally, we decided to pursue a platform that provides real-time, accurate data on EV charging locations for consumers, as well as analytics for EV-related data that are collected from our platform. It brought together relevant stakeholders, such as the government, private companies, as well as consumers, and we projected to increase the EV uptake in Singapore by 30%! We saw potential in analysing such data for REITs in future as well, as research showed a correlation between EV charging stations and retail traffic in shopping malls.    I would like to thank:  Our mentor , who shared his own interesting experiences and insights about the EV industry and stakeholders to us.  My teammates: , , , , for the amazing job while we were all juggling full-time internships during this challenge.  Accenture and staff for the hard work organising this challenge, and entertaining our weird requests; emailing the photoshopped team image because our full team couldn't make it  And last but not least, the people I met during the challenge: including my SUSS comrades and ; my (CHAMPION) bro who I met after a very long time; and for chilling with us after the sessions!

Each market identifies with a different set of challenges – from unequal access to healthcare, supply chain disruption, inadequate cold chain monitoring processes, counterfeit drugs, and vaccine waste. While we are at a crucial point in the history of technological advancement in healthcare, we must recognise that the existence of these challenges will be a strong driving force to progress in 2022.     Innovation has become crucial to addressing these issues. An Research highlights that 90% of pharma executives are working with technology firms to fast-track access to new tech capabilities and accelerate innovation, as a way to propel the industry forward – fulfilling new patient demands. With close to a $7 billion investment in healthcare by the top tech firms to improve on data collection and management for better patient experience, many are banking on these investments and partnerships to guide positive change.      This enthusiasm towards change and an increased adoption of digital services allows us to mitigate some of the challenges we face together as an industry.

Flashback to the beforetimes of October 2019, and I decided to leave the safety nest (a net that had become a cozy home) of Accenture to join a tiny chemical innovation startup, BPS Technology, LLC. They asked me to help refine their marketing strategy. I embraced the chance to stretch my legs. Flashforward to January 2022, and again they asked me to stretch. This time as their Chief Strategy Officer.    I've always loved doing marketing that's very close to the business. And boy have I learned a lot about the business of chemicals, horticulture, commodity agriculture, fertilizer, oil and gas, and supramolecular chemistry. But now they've entrusted me with a bigger vision. (, I'm grateful for the opportunity!)    Being at a startup on the cutting edge of scientific discovery is more than I could have ever dreamed. Getting to help refine our mission, vision, and value proposition has been a delight and a challenge. I've had to call in peers and advisors (looking at you, , , ) to advance us along the way, and we still have really good work to do.    It's been a privilege to tell our story. Whether it's a step change in environmentally conscious oil and gas production; improving corn yields with better fertilizer efficiency; better cannabis production with bolstered bud yield; or seeing greenhouse growers get better turn times and plant health--our patented supramolecular chemistry is first-of-its-kind and delivers remarkable results. I shake my head every day at trial results and customer testimonials. Mind. Blowing. (Thanks , , , , , and many others for so much astounding fodder!)    So yes, this is a new chapter. One of personal growth. One of a startup at the tipping point. One of sustainability (that makes my environmentalist heart pitter-patter). One of faith. Thanks for reading along with me.

Always an interesting read, here are our key takeaways from the 5 major trends presented in Fjord’s report:    𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞: “The rising individualism underlined by a “me over we” mentality is stressing empathy between colleagues within companies and changing people’s aspirations as consumers, which presents new challenges and opportunities for employers and brand owners alike”.     𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐛𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠: “When designing for the balance between affordability and sustainability, organizations need to decouple innovation from the notion of “new”.    𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐫: “The metaverse is less about a world of unicorns and dragons, and more about escaping the limits of physical walls to spend time in a virtual world”.     𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞: “Brand conversations with customers will evolve to structurally solve the challenge of providing the right answer at the right time and in the right way”.     𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞:“Care has moved center stage, reminding us of the importance of kindness and compassion. The many different aspects of care, the challenges of caring, and the cost and role of carers have become more visible and more widely discussed. This is creating opportunities and challenges for all employers and brands— health and non-health. How companies design for all aspects of care will likely set them apart, and be a key component for future success”.',\n",

After almost two decades in the Data and Analytics industry, working with big and small companies, I was looking for trifecta of AI innovation, Client centricity and People First culture and Bridgei2i offered all three. It was a tough change by all means as I was joining this organisation in a leadership position where everyone was working remotely and all the more challenging to build relationships and influence outcomes. However, very quickly Bridgei2i became home as I met like minded leaders, go getter team and forged great friendships in the phygital world.    And what more can I ask for, as I won the last Bridgei2i’s CEO award for outstanding performance. I thank , and for the trust and support at every step that helped me find my wings and soar.

In my 35 years of being a holistic patient-centered physician and transformational leader, I’ve been grateful to have got mental clarity to discover my true purpose and the right “doses” of energy and intrinsic motivation for dedicating myself daily to what really-really-really matters to me:    creating for many human beings on this planet the conditions for an healthy, happy and purposeful life and to become the best version of themselves.    Today I just feel the need to express, from the bottom of my heart, my deepest gratitude for ALL the amazing people and opportunities I’ve encountered on my Accenture path to make an impact, personally and with my Accenture teams, in this past year.    Differently from many others in my same age, who are mainly busy with their retirement plans, I love still working at the new version of myself for the next 30 years, remaining inspired to keep supporting the physical and mental health and well-being of other people.    For one year I felt committed myself to contribute to the vision and execution of to bring human potential and digital health technology together - in a future global metaverse with a deep emphasis on Humanity.    I’ve learned so much in this past year, but I’ll share with you these three pearls:    1. Care for the people.  With all that we’ve collectively experienced in recent years, it’s been proven that the health of business has never been more reliant and dependent on the health of its people. Caring for the people, with empathy, is a business imperative.    2. Become your best self, authentically.  Many days, like many of you, I thrive on getting things done, working at several exciting project at the same time. Bringing my whole self to work and life. However, I’ve come to appreciate that high performance can only be sustainable if you take care not only of your FLOW moments, but also of your recovery phases. And so, on one side, DEEP WORK TIME is as important as RECOVERY TIME, so that I can be at my best every day. On the other side, we ALL are a “multiplicity symphony of several selves”. Therefore, we should not only become the best version of our self, but also \"orchestrating the symphony of our selves\". Being authentic and contextually focused, with the \"right temporary self\" at the “right time”, with the “right people”.    3. Keep learning.  In challenging oneself and the status quo to learn/take on something new/be disruptive, we have the opportunity to discover, transform, grow,innovate.    There aren’t enough words to fully express my gratitude to you - my Accenture peers, friends, and CALs - who partnered with me to lead this important work and created space for me to learn and lead authentically.

The 2021/2022 academic year naturally came with its challenges but the most decisive period was the summer; a time when each student had to find a meaningful and fulfilling internship to work on.     I started my internship applications in tech, finance and marketing companies/ start-ups in March 2022. I applied to , , , , etc but guess what? All I got were rejections. I got rejected by about 10 companies and it started getting frustrating since May(the start of the internship period) was fast approaching. As a result, my friend and I decided to move from office to office to deposit our cover letters and resumes. We went to the heart of the innovative centre in Mauritius (Moka) armed with our printed resumes and cover letters- we walked from company to company trying to meet the HR managers, in some we met them, in others we needed appointments and other simply did not receive us. The exercise was really tiring but got exciting when we got guaranteed by HSBC that we would likely receive a call from them. Long story short, after depositing our documents to eight (8) different companies, we did not even get a rejection email, talk less of a call.     Back to reality and understanding that it would not be that easy to get an internship, I changed my strategy and had to revamp my entire CV, modify my cover letter to a more suitable format and apply to even more companies. I finally got 4 amazing offers; 3 for marketing positions and one for a business development position. I eventually decided to work with as the Marketing acquisition intern and with which is a Canada-registered Kenyan-based advisory group, as a business development and investor relations intern. The months that followed were very intense, but at the same time really enriching. I learned myriad things from both teams: building and monitoring marketing strategies that generated over 200000+ leads, doing financial forecasts and modelling alongside building investor teasers and briefs for start-up and institutional investors.

Trend 8: Metaverse Technology    According to a recent Accenture report ‘Life Sciences Technology Vision 2022’, industry leaders expect the metaverse to have a strong impact on their organizations.    Despite the metaverse still being in its early days, the report claims that the Life Sciences industry is ripe for integrating further pioneering digital solutions within the metaverse for how people and organisations interact. The report details how four technological cornerstones could underpin the sector’s entry into the metaverse:    WebMe explores how the internet is used to create digital experiences between people and organisations. WebMe would reinvent how data can be owned by individuals, as it would be shifted with the person and not the platform.    The Programmable World tracks how technology is being weaved through our physical environments in three layers: connected, experiential, and material. Nearly nine-in-10 of the MedTech and biopharma executives surveyed in the report believe that programming the physical environment will emerge as a competitive differentiation in their industry.    The Unreal explores the more ‘unreal’ qualities that are becoming fundamental to artificial intelligence as well as data, making the synthetic seem authentic. This realistic (yet ‘unreal’) data can be shared, maintaining the same statistical properties while protecting confidentiality and privacy. It can be developed to accommodate increased diversity to counter bias, thus overcoming the pitfalls of real-world data.    Computing the Impossible is the emergence of a new class of machines - ‘quantum computing’ - which stretches the boundaries of what computers are capable of. Problems once thought impossible to solve because they require computing large, complex datasets are now in the realm of possibility.

The report identifies five major emerging trends & challenges that have significant implications for the year:  1. Come as you are. We’re starting to see an era of post-traumatic opportunity (my term) take shape. One study found that some 71% of executives said 2020 was their most stressful work year ever and 53% reported struggling with mental health issues at work, while 76% of employees believe their employers should take more responsibility for their mental wellbeing. Two-thirds of UK and US study participants, and almost all in China, India and South Africa said they have changed the way they think about purpose at work.  2. The end of abundance thinking. Global shortages and lockdowns have permeated, creating a sense that we need to consume less and give back more. Climate change has also accelerated thinking around increased sustainability and new expectations of convenience. Companies are now decoupling \"innovation\" and \"new\" and are thinking differently about value creation (less doesn\\'t have to mean loss -- do we need new smart gadgets every year?).  3. Digital culture is accelerating. The move to converge physical and digital worlds (again) is bringing a new rush to investment in digital assets that mimic our physical world. 75% of those polled in this study were excited about the future of their digital experiences, citing things like improved communications between people, better access to information, and a more convenient life. Companies need to embrace entirely new ways of formulating digital strategies for both employees and customers.  4. Human expectations for answers have evolved. A generation after the founding of Google, we now expect immediate answers to any question we have. Furthermore, we are less trusting of information sources outside of our own social cohorts. Nine out of ten customers seek information about products/services online before they make a purchasing decision. Brands are now formulating new information layers across all customer touchpoints. These layers must be transparent and simple.  5. People\\'s default is now care and compassion. In the UK, 87% of HR leaders have experienced increased numbers of employees disclosing issues around mental health, and 82% have seen greater numbers of staff reporting feelings of loneliness. 73% of people around the world now consider “wellness” an essential element of any brand’s strategy.

Wooohooooo Congratulations to the Globe Business Enterprise Group!!! 🎉🎉🎉    LEAD-IN 2020    Overcoming Fear & Uncertainty    2020 was a year where enterprises had to take the biggest pivot in recent history in more ways than one. COVID-19 had impacted the lives of people globally, creating a halo effect on business growth and operations. Philippine enterprises, while constantly evolving, needed to accelerate their digital transformation. Facing much uncertainty, enterprises could not make themselves victims of circumstance, but rather, frontiers of courageous leadership and drivers of innovative culture.    Enterprise leaders needed guidance and strength during this time, which Globe Business provided through the annual Leadership Innovation Forum (Lead-In). The theme of the event was “Forward & Fearless: A Path Towards a Braver Tomorrow.” It aimed to inspire and enable a culture of digital transformation through courageous leadership at all levels of the organization. Adapting to the new normal, the format had changed from face-to-face engagement to a virtual event.    CLOCKWORK WEBISODES    Getting to know CEOs inside and beyond the boardroom    To ensure that the interview was more entertaining than the typical webinars that enterprise leaders are used to, Clockwork was divided into segments that showed the different sides of the guest CEOs. The first segment dwelled on the more human-interest side of things as CEOs shared their secrets and habits that made them who they are today. The show's second segment then zoomed in on exciting new technologies, success stories, and innovations that challenge the norm. Furthermore, the show does not constrain itself to discuss only solutions carried by Globe today. All schools of thought, processes, and technologies brought up by the guests may guide customers in developing or redeveloping their own processes.    The first three episodes of the series featured some of the most successful people in the Philippines: Ernest Cu (President and CEO of Globe Telecom), Ray Alimurung (CEO of Lazada Group Philippines), and Lito Tayag (Country Managing Director of Accenture Philippines). These three business leaders kept the discussions light and more interesting. These episodes were then amplified through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Youtube. Hosting of the webisodes was done by Edu Manzano.\",\n",

Now they have all been merged together to create the metaverse. A virtual world which as Mark Zuckerberg says is “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”    Sounds cool doesn\\'t it? Well, I\\'m not so sure. Its certainly being hyped. Facebook renamed itself Meta, Accenture\\'s 2022 Technology Vision report is called \\'Meet me in the Metaverse\\' and Microsoft cited it as a reason for acquiring Activision Blizzard, saying the deal would provide \"building blocks for the metaverse.\"    The term metaverse comes straight out of science fiction, coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book Snow Crash, and lots of people plan to make money off of it.    Apparently gaming, avatars and virtual worlds will soon be essential to our lives. Deloitte touts its metaverse capabilities as offering \\'an innovation space where Deloitte professionals and clients can develop and test break-through capabilities that leverage virtual worlds powered by enabling technologies.\\' That\\'s a lot of buzzwords for one sentence!    PWC says \\'The metaverse promises a stunningly realistic 3D digital world where you can (for example) purchase and sell goods and services, sign and enforce contracts, recruit and train talent, and interact with customers and communities.\\'  Not much there about making the world a better place.    So the metaverse is all about creating a virtual representation of the real world so you can make more money. Why do we need another world? I know real life is tough but is the answer to replicate it and then allow you to pretend to be someone you\\'re not, doing something you can\\'t, in a place where you don\\'t exist, to earn rewards that aren\\'t real?    I\\'ve been involved in technology for almost 45 years and have seen a lot of \\'waves\\' and \\'breakthroughs\\' most of which promised more than they delivered.    Creating value means delivering something that\\'s useful. At the moment most of the discussion seems to surround peripheral use cases--games, social media, crypto, NFTs, etc. I am much more interested to see how the metaverse is going to help address real world\\'s biggest challenges.

But while financial capital may not a problem for them, human capital is rare.    And yet, human capital is vital – it’s the competitive advantage, it\\'s what companies should be caring about. All the money in the world can\\'t replace the work we do that comes out of a particular passion or purpose.    Industry so often forgets that. I regularly see companies neglecting the biggest asset they have: their people. I have heard business leaders claim that people will be replaced by robots; I hear dire predictions of a “jobless future”. Apparently, 67% of CEOs believe technology, not people, is the key to survival.    It\\'s true that Artificial Intelligence, automation and other new technologies are becoming hugely important for business. According to Accenture, AI has the potential to boost rates of profitability by an average of 38% by 2035 and lead to an economic boost of US$14 trillion across 16 industries in 12 economies by 2035.    But the way so many leaders think about change, digital innovation and the workplace is all wrong. Rather than focusing on how technology will de-humanise the workplace, we should be thinking about how we can use it to amplify human potential. It can’t be about destroying human relations or we have no future as a planet!    Amplifying human potential    At the core of what brings innovation, ideas and progress is us – human beings. Our ideas, our passions, our ability to innovate, our creativity, those are the things that actually create the solutions to the big challenges this world is facing.    Technology must be a catalyst for positive transformation: it must help us ignite the human spark. Technology must help us find our purpose, identify the right people for the right roles, elevate our learning and nurture our mental health.

As an energy giant, will Russia be building a new ecosystem?    Since the post Soviet era and 1998 banking collapse, Western capital and corporates has been flowing into Russia, with a large acceleration following the globalisation in year 2000. All this came to a sharp disruption in 2014 when the Russia-Ukraina war first started. Russia is a European country, although mindsets are different, Russians are great at doing business with Europeans. However, in 2013, Russian FDI, two thirds from EU, was only representing 2-3% of Russia\\'s GDP, roughly at par with the energy export value and double of all other exports. Since then Russian GDP has fallen by 25%.    So, who is the new taker of the Russian economy. China is not only laughing at the West, they are laughing at Russia. With excess of \"blood-stained\" energy supplies, there is only one market. Whilst logistical challenges are many, over time China can secure a cheap flow of energy.    And, who will develop Russian businesses? Putin\\'s 20 years has rendered in a business environment led by cronies with stagnating development. When did you last hear about innovation and Russia in one sentence? Their digital economy is still only ranked #41 in the global ICT development index and the number of unicorns are only 1/4 of those from Denmark. 1/2 of Indonesia, and at par with Malta and Philippines. There are many local brands and strong local wealth, however the money is flowing into European brands (many exempt from sanctions BTW.).    At the end of the day, an resource-rich economy, full of cronyism, and with a solid consumer wealth. Who might be interested? Consumer brands, industrial supplies, and energy trade. Looks like like it is not the last time we saw Putin and Xi Jinping together. And, increasingly, Putin will realise that Xi Jinping is the taller one. Obama did his Pivot to asia in 2012, Putin in 2022.    And congratulations China!',\n",

The subject of CBDC has provoked some vociferous discussion lately. The advocates believe that CBDC can accelerate financial depth, stimulate innovation, and act as a catalyst for digitization in payments.

That over 80% of central banks have dived head-first into the CBDC abyss is the harbinger of things to come.    This blog shines the spotlight on the driving factors fueling CBDC pilots across the globe, the barriers to its widespread acceptance, and the implications for commercial banks, regulators, and end-users.  \",\n",

After two years of C-19 restrictions, it’s been exciting to start seeing our global team and clients face to face again, listen to, and discuss the technical and commercial challenges that will be needed to overcome in the race to net zero.    During the week, some of the points we heard –    · Super-charging the supply chain to meet capital project pipeline demand will be a key decider in meeting net zero targets for Renewables  · Development of supply chains need to go back further to consider materials vs. only component manufacturing  · Assessing auctions on whole system value is crucial to slowing down the race to the bottom and enabling a just transition  · Licensing, permitting, consents, leasing needs to be accelerated through standardisation, simplification, digitalisation, and more frequent cycles  · Enabling and understanding how to collaborate in a multi-stakeholder environment will be a competitive advantage    Check out my quick blog post if you’d like to read more about my personal key takeaways from the week!',\n",

It wasn’t an easy year, but what made it possible were the wonderful people who came together to push forward CFTE’s mission 🌟    2021 has brought a lot of ups and downs to everyone, and we hope that you were safe this year. For CFTE, there were many ups (our alumni doing really well in a year of change, 1,000 virtual interns onboarded, dozens of new programmes, the launch of CFTE France,…) but some downs too (third lockdown in the UK, health of our team and their families).    I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who were involved with us at CFTE, the Center for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship to grow and reach new heights this year.    Our wonderful team, all the experts, the partners have worked incredibly hard to continue to provide education at scale in Fintech through courses and also through events that have proven to be a quintessential tool for those looking to reskill or upskill in a world that has only grown more digital.    So while 2021 was a time of continuing challenges due to the pandemic, it was also a year of limitless possibilities 🌟:    Thank you each and everyone for making 2021 a year of limitless possibilities.
