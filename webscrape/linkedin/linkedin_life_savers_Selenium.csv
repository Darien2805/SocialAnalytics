"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place.    I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Godwinn W.    Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.    Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act.    The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.    Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me.    Special Thanks  Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon.",Tenacious Self-Starter Who Loves Developing Software

"Whew, I still can’t believe 2021 flew by so quickly. Want to do a 2021 roundup before the year ends.    Earlier this year, I was awarded the Student Category for The Cyber Security Awards (TCA) 2020. I’m deeply humbled and grateful for that.    I published an article on an introduction to honeypots, and if you haven’t already checked out, you can check it out here:    I’m also glad to have done a sharing session with earlier this year and am happy to see how the Interest Group have grown and thrived. Moreover, NYP SIT now has a thriving ecosystem of Interest Groups (NYP InfoSec, NYP DSC, NYP AI and NYP LIT).    Towards the middle of the year, I participated in the SCDFxIBM Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge: Call For Code 2021 with some of my polytechnic friends and walked away as the third runner-up.  You can check the video produced by our team here:  I happened to recently come across an article from CNA () that shows similar ideas being put on trial in real life which is exciting!    Towards the end of the year, I found some time to participate in 2 CTFs namely TISC and HTX Investigator’s Challenge. I was stuck at Level 2 for the TISC CTF and didn’t manage to move forward. For the HTX Investigator’s Challenge, my team and I finished at 38th place. Grateful to have found some time towards the end of the year to continue honing my cyber skills.    Moving forward into 2022, there are many things to be excited about. First, I will be starting university next year. I hope to be more involved with the cybersecurity communities next year. Hopefully, the COVID situation gets better next year and there will be more physical events for the community after 2 long years fighting the virus. We definitely have to live with the virus and move towards a new normal. I'm currently working on an article and I hope to publish it soon!",Graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic

"The UNFPA Bangladesh Country Representative Kristine Blokus was being received in Camp 4 Hope Field Hospital-UKhiya by George Otieno the UNFPA-SRH Team Lead Cox's Bazar. The Visit took place on 25-8-2022 and was led by UNFPA Regional Director Bjorn Andersson. “The realities of humanitarian crises around the world and the need for multisectoral and innovative partnerships across all layers of society and the humanitarian community are visible here”said Kristine  Five years into the Rohingya people’s mass exodus to Bangladesh, caused by escalating violence and decades of marginalization, those who have sought refuge and normalcy continue to face great challenges, although their situation is more stable now.  Some traveled to Cox’s Bazar, currently the world’s largest refugee camp which houses close to one million Rohingya refugees. One would meet with Rohingya people, the host communities, the frontline workers including health care professionals and service providers and UNFPA’s partners, both governmental and civil society organizations. From these encounters and the good discussions One had with the community representatives and partners, one could witness how over the course of the last five years, everyone has come together to respond to the vast needs, including the refugees themselves who have endured immense trauma across generations.  From the onset of the crisis in 2017, UNFPA has established and gradually expanded programmes to respond to gender-based violence, provide sexual and reproductive health services, and empower and engage young people. Now there are 236 midwives who have received mentorship support and are putting those acquired skills into practice at both governmental and non-governmental health facilities. Women and girls are receiving lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services through 22 health facilities, 39 women- friendly spaces and 5 multi-purpose women centres which serve both Rohingya refugees and host communities. It was witnessed during the visit how effective referral between sexual and reproductive health, and gender- based violence response services helped to ensure that the needs of women and girls are met. At the UNFPA-supported Hope Field Hospital, we saw how midwives strive to ensure every mother delivers safely, despite complications that require urgent medical attention.  UNFPA is also strengthening the monitoring and surveillance of maternal mortality to ensure that the risks faced by women during pregnancy or childbirth are identified through joint approaches among the various humanitarian actors. We observed activities at a Women Led Community Centre, one of 10 such centres supported by UNFPA and our donors, and run by partners in Cox’s Bazar. The Centre supports women and girls through skills development and economic empowerment and is one important example stakeholders are coming together to fight gender-based violence, advance gender equality andwomen and girls in the Rohingya said Bjorn","Team Leader-Sexual, Reproductive Health and Rights Unit UNFPA, Cox’s Bazar & Coordinator SRH Working Group"

"Welcome to a new series of “My Journey at SalaryBox” where we talk with the team about how they got to SalaryBox, and what their stories have been.    Today we spoke with , a Software Engineer at our Gurgaon office, about what makes his work challenging and exciting.    📍What do you do at SalaryBox?  I’m a Software developer who joined the team in January 2022. I make sure that the web app and iOS interface used for millions of SalaryBox customers is up and running. We've redesigned the entire interface over the last couple of months, and also moved from Flutter to . This ensured that our customers have a great experience while using the product. I can see things improving as a result of my work, and that’s really satisfying.      📍How did you land in your current role?  I was a student of in Dehradun, and SalaryBox had come for campus placements. Funnily enough, I did not get selected after the final round. I was still very keen to join and reached out to the founders directly, to apply for an internship. The next thing I know that I was working with them a week later. Seeing my work, my internship was converted into a full-time role.   By joining SalaryBox I realized how much I value constant innovation and building new systems and tools. One of the coolest things about building new things is that it requires you to understand the vast scope of work, read and upskill yourself every day. It’s challenging, yet exciting work.    📍What’s a typical workday like for you?   Most of my day involves designing and building out the SalaryBox website app, so a lot of writing code and reading technical documentation ( and are lifesavers! ). I’d say I spend 15% of my time syncing with colleagues on updates for ongoing projects. I’m fortunate to have a variety of projects to work on — this helps me feel constantly challenged and motivated to work. Each morning we get together for an hour or so to discuss our weekly sprint goals. This allows us to make sure we’re on track as a team and to plan the rest of the week.  I feel like I have a great balance between collaborating and working independently.     📍What inspires you to come in every day?   It would be unfair not to mention all the amazing people I work with on a daily basis — my colleagues are a crucial part of the work I do. The support system here is incredible, and they guide me on how the current app is structured, and how new things can be added.  I've interacted with a lot of my friends, who are currently working at MNCs and other larger organizations. Sadly, they are yet to be allocated tasks and given core responsibilities. I, on the other hand, have been entrusted with multiple high-impact development items, and the ownership of my work really motivates me. Working at a startup has been a fantastic learning curve, and I've upskilled myself in multiple ways - that includes playing table tennis!","9,524 followers"

"Blue Ocean Innovation 2022 🌊⚓️    The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 14 is to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources.”    To achieve this, it is important to support the blue economy encouraging sustainable start-up companies, innovators and innovations that can scale to solve the ocean’s grand challenges.     1️⃣) Plant-based fish and seafood products🐟    Plant-based innovation is one of the biggest and most exciting growth areas in the food industry today, and while meat substitutes are the fastest growing sub-category in this market (an increase of 152 percent in 2019), fish and shellfish alternatives are now poised for dynamic growth.    Investment in alternative fish and seafood startups has been brisk, with new companies and products starting to expand the market.    2️⃣) Reversing the plastics crisis🧴    Plastics are useful. They're used to help make lifesaving medical supplies, lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts, and insulation for our homes. But nearly half of all plastic produced goes towards single-use items such as bags, straws, utensils and takeout containers.     There's a number of companies trying to develop cost-efficient and eco-friendly substitutes, from mushroom packaging to advanced fibers and plastic-free online shopping.     3️⃣) Ocean-based renewable energies⚡️    Rapid transformation of our energy systems is required if we are to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit the global average temperature rise. In addition to expanding land-based renewable energy, the ocean offers significant potential for supporting this transition.    However, new technologies must be implemented in a sustainable way in order to avoid unintended consequences that could undermine other aspects of ocean health.

"Today, more than 20 months since India and South Africa first proposed a landmark intellectual property (IP) Waiver for #COVID19 medical tools at the World Trade Organization (WTO), governments have reached a decision. Dr. Christos Christou, International President of MSF shares his thoughts:    “We are disappointed with the inadequate outcome on waiving intellectual property for COVID-19 medical tools that resulted from more than 20 months of deliberations.    We acknowledge that a few changes were made to the agreement that mitigated some of the most worrisome elements of the earlier text presented in May 2022, but overall, we are disappointed that a true intellectual property waiver, proposed in October 2020 covering all COVID-19 medical tools and including all countries, could not be agreed, even during a pandemic that has claimed more than 15 million people’s lives.    This agreement fails overall to offer an effective and meaningful solution to help increase people’s access to needed medical tools during the pandemic, as it does not adequately waive intellectual property on all essential COVID-19 medical tools, and it does not apply to all countries. The measures outlined in the decision will not address pharmaceutical monopolies or ensure affordable access to lifesaving medical tools and will set a negative precedent for future global health crises and pandemics.    Throughout the pandemic, MSF has repeatedly pointed out the challenges and struggles faced by frontline healthcare workers in providing care for people facing COVID-19. Despite lofty political commitments and words of solidarity, it has been discouraging for us to see that wealthy countries failed to resolve the glaring inequities in access to lifesaving COVID-19 medical tools for people in low- and middle-income countries.    Without agreement on a true global solution to ongoing access challenges, MSF now urges governments to take immediate steps at the national level to make sure people have access to needed COVID-19 medical tools. Governments should consider using all available legal and policy options, including suspending intellectual property on COVID-19 medical tools, issuing compulsory licenses on key medical technologies to overcome patent barriers, and adopting new laws and policies to ensure the disclosure of essential technical information needed to support generic production and supply.    MSF also calls on governments to take concrete steps to rethink and reform the biomedical innovation system to ensure that lifesaving medical tools are developed, produced and supplied equitably where monopoly-based and market-driven principles are not a barrier to access. It is time to prioritize saving lives instead of protecting corporate and political interests.”","68,030 followers"
"On 19 July 2022, CITRIS Workforce Innovation Program interns, Azarely, Manjari, and I had an illuminating interview with Paula Padrino Vilela, an expert in the field of disaster management who worked for international organizations including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), NATO, and the UN Environment Program (UNEP) to help prevent and mitigate the effects of disasters on human life. She is currently the project coordinator of UNEP and is working to bring emerging technologies including fields like artificial intelligence, robotics, drones, and the Internet of Things (IOT) to the forefront of disaster response to more effectively prevent damage and save lives.     Paula related her insight into the rapidly changing world we live in. The effects of climate change only serve to accelerate the damage and death tolls incurred by disasters worldwide, but technology is also developing at an ever-quickening pace, allowing for new avenues to fight disasters every day. She sees artificial intelligence as the main technology that will allow for effective disaster prevention, while innovations in the fields of robotics, autonomous vehicles and IOT support the revolutionary power of AI. For example, robots and drones use AI for navigation and making autonomous decisions in the field, while the advent of the IoT lets widely distributed sensor suites feed data into a large data set to further improve upon and gain results from AI.      She also shared some of the challenges that least developed and developing countries face while working on disaster prevention and mitigation. These countries are often the most harshly impacted by climate change and its associated environmental effects, but have the least funds available for which to deal with them. Instead of pursuing the most cutting-edge technologies that first-world countries often do, they invest in simpler, proven, and durable means by which to detect and prevent disasters, which is something that must be kept in mind in order to make these lifesaving products accessible to all who require it.     Our interview with Paula helped us glean much insight into the field of disaster management worldwide, not just in the United States where we live. We hope to apply this knowledge in our work and beyond as the world grapples with a warming environment and an increasing frequency of disasters.",Systems Lead at Space Technologies and Rocketry

"Yesterday I gave a speech at The Australian Financial Review Government Services Summit.      If you are interested here are some extracts and the full copy is below in link 🙏     🔹Globalisation was not just about trading commodities on large ships. In the digital age, it's about sharing something far more powerful - ideas - on the internet. Whilst commodities are physical, ideas are intangible. So Trust has an even bigger role to play.     🔹When you place a digital lens over history, an unfortunate dovetail emerges. When the Cold War officially ended in the early 1990s, it was replaced with the beginning of the cyber war. Back then cyber was just starting to warm up - now it is dangerously simmering.      🔹Many people are uncomfortable that a Government would refer to people as ‘Customers’ as opposed to ‘Citizens’. The rationale is simple. Govt provide services to refugees, visa holders and tourists - who are not citizens.      Customer is an inclusive term, which means everybody is entitled to quality service delivery - citizens and refugees alike.      🔹We can use digital to empower the individual, build more Trust and therefore strengthen our precious democracy.     There is no other way forward. A trustless world, is a world of ever diminishing tribes.","Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Fair Trading at NSW Government & Member for Ryde"

"Is the advent of UPI going to eventually make cash and card transactions a thing of the past?     In recent years, a large portion of the Indian public has switched to transacting through UPI, and this is because:    1. It’s fast, hassle-free and a cost-effective way to transfer your money.    2. It requires nothing more that a two-factor authentication process.    3. UPI apps have made it extremely convenient for users to link their bank accounts to the app online; and    4.

"This week is Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week (2-8th May). As part of this, I've written an article about ""Maternal Mental Health in the Workplace"", using my lived experience of postnatal depression as an example.    I would love it if you could read the article, and share it with anyone who might benefit from my reflections.    Most advice that I've found on postnatal depression tends to focus on the person who is suffering, their family or friends, or healthcare professionals. I hope that this article will extend this, and help to bring the discussion into the workplace.    I have some suggestions of how employers and colleagues might help women who are experiencing postnatal depression and other perinatal mental problems, but I don't claim to have the answers. Hopefully this article will spark reflection and conversation within the particular context of your own organisation.    The article includes links to further information if you want to find out more about maternal mental health (and paternal mental health: check out , founded by ).    Definitely take a look at the website of the fantastic Perinatal Mental Health Partnership, who run the campaign ( - founded by ). And take a look at the .

"HERA - THE WORLD'S ONLY BACKPACKED DRONE FROM VIETNAM    All backpackable drones ever made have a lift capacity from 1 to 5 pounds max. To serve the majority of use cases, the lift has to be around 30 pounds. Having both backpack portability and a sixfold increase in lift capacity turned out to be extremely challenging. Nobody from giant drone makers to new startups has been able to find an answer.     Realtime Robotics (RtR) is the only drone manufacturer that has successfully tackled this puzzle. Our Hera drone is small enough to fit in a backpack, yet powerful enough to lift 33-lb payloads, mount four gimbaled payloads simultaneously, deliver 360-degree FOV for every payload, and ensure data transparency and security. Hera simply sets the world records in almost all critical features, an unprecedented achievement in drone history.
