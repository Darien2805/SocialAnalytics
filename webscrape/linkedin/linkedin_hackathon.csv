1,"I remember taking part in my first #hackathon, which basically came up with an (rather embarrassingly named) app for isolated elderly to get connected called... ""Tinderly"" 📱

Well I'm sure that there are many better ideas that can be unleashed with the best of Google Cloud's tech, and we're excited to host them at our recently-launched Google for Startups Cloud Hackathon Singapore 2022!

📣  Calling all students, educators, IHLs, aspiring founders and incubators, will be grateful if you can help spread the word! Find out more and start registering your teams today (closes 8 May) to tackle topics including #sustainability, #AI and #ML at https://goo.gle/35UPZAg

2,"I recently returned to manage an event, but this time with new friends and a new position: as one of four coordinators of Curtin Singapore's HACKATHON Event. Despite the fact that ComSSA, Curtin Australia, and Curtin Singapore only collaborated for two days, I learnt a lot from these activities, including work culture, the cycle of hosting an event at Curtin Singapore, leadership, and offering solutions...

Hopefully, in the future, I will be able to study more and take on greater responsibilities at Curtin Singapore. #leadership #event #singapore"

Join the hackathon today !!! 🚀 🚀

5,"It has truly been a great experience and learning journey being a participant in UNLEASH Singapore Hackathon 2022. The hackathon tasked us with identifying innovative solutions toward achieving the UN SDGs (specifically on climate change, education and health). We also had guests speakers to talk on key topics such as #ecoanxiety #venturecapital.

Being an enthusiast of sustainability and believing that corporates can play a significant role towards a net-zero future, I knew I had to join this hackathon and learn from the community to think of solutions.

Throughout the hackathon week, I was mentally stretched as our team had to rethink our problem statement and continuously use probing questions to find the root causes. We looked into #greenjobs #corporatesustainability and #employability.

The beauty of the UNLEASH methodology (Problem framing -> Ideation -> Empathising -> Prototyping -> Pitching) was truly rigorous and I did doubt my mental capabilities at times. Nonetheless, I always believe it is only through tough processes that one can make oneself improve. From the process, I do feel more confident in finding tensions in society and ideating solutions. After all, it is useless to rehash current solutions and reinvent the wheel. What we need to do is to find gaps in the market and solve them collaboratively.

Overall, this enjoyable hackathon process would not have been possible without my valuable teammates (Yiong Jon Lon , Meiyu, Jiezhi and Nicholas), mentors and organisers.

Till next time!

7,"Over the past 2 weeks, I participated in Crypto.com's hackathon, with some awesome people - Colin Chan, Yong Kang Chia, Kasshif Mohamed, and Adithya - and I'm proud to say that we emerged as champions!

Our project focuses on decentralised cooperative banking, where we enable people to pool their funds together, specifically for those living in areas where traditional banking infra is lacking. Hence, we named our product DeCoop.

While we had many great ideas, we focussed on creating an MVP where users can easily create/join community funds through a Telegram bot, which generates links / QR codes to execute an on-chain transaction seamlessly. For this hackathon, we also built an analytics web app for users to manage the community funds that they are involved in, along with some macro statistics.

Here are the links for those interested:

12,"I am proud to announce that I have graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with BSc Honours (Highest Distinction) in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) and a minor in Economics. It was my honour to receive my degree certificate from the President of Singapore and the NTU Chancellor, Her Excellency Madam Halimah Yacob herself.

These four years have passed in the blink of an eye but I have had the opportunity to connect with some brilliant minds and had experiences of a lifetime. To be part of NTU’s pioneering batch of students graduating in DSAI was such a unique opportunity. I consider myself lucky to be among twenty three  other driven, ambitious and futuristic classmates who taught me valuable life lessons. 

Being part of NTUMUN 2020-21 secretariat as a USG, being featured among the top ten teams in the Singapore India Hackathon 2019-20 and my internships with Inteliment, Singapore Airlines and Bank of America are some indelible memories outside of my course that proved to be amazing  learning opportunities. 

I would like to thank my professors - Prof Sourav Sen Gupta, Prof Jagath Rajapakse, Prof Akshar Saxena and Dr. Parvin Kumar, Ph.D. for being such impactful mentors. I am also grateful to my parents, friends and peers for their constant support and encouragement.

I am happy to share that I have kick-started my career with Bank of America as a Technology Analyst. Here’s to new beginnings and new learnings and hope the dream runs on….

13,"Over the past week, the YouthxHack initiative from Cyber Youth Singapore concluded with a blast with different booths set up by participants to showcase their solutions to the various judges from ST Engineering, Exabytes Group, and Mandiant.

This year's YouthxHack initiative focused on the theme 'Automation in Cybersecurity', whereby teams looked to innovate and ideate solutions within the offensive, defensive, and investigative sectors of Cybersecurity.

With YouthxHack's aim to bring together like-minded individuals to the currently evolving technological landscape within Singapore, the hackathon's key focus was not based on the technical skills of the participants, but rather, the creative and surprising ideas participants could come up with, while inculcating the different perspective and aspects from different parties from organizations (towards real-world business gaps) to even non-commercial use (towards general users like you and me!).

Being lucky enough, I was presented with the amazing opportunity to oversee this 6-day hackathon as the Program Director. Alongside with Chong Hong Yau, we ensured the logistics & communications with externals sponsors and participants. Without a doubt, a huge thank you to both Hong Yau & the Cyber Youth Singapore team who ensure that all plans and executions were performed without fail.

I would like to thank the sponsors, ST Engineering (title sponsor!), Exabytes, and Mandiant for their continuous support throughout the course of the hackathon! This hackathon brought the experts within these organizations to the youths, acting as a bridge between these two differing parties!

We can't forget the Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Integrated Events & Project Management (DEPM) student team who supported us with numerous back-end and last-minute late-night plannings😅! Thank you all so much!

All in all, the YouthxHack initiative was a great success! Congratulations winning teams - from the sponsor champions, to special mentions and all the participants!

See you next time!

I talked about my journey as a GovTechie working in different projects over the years, before segway to the main topic on accessibility!

I shared what accessibility and inclusion means, an intro to assistive tools, and why we should build for accessibility. Building a product/service for accessibility not just benefit persons with disabilities, but everyone.

Glad to meet the young inquisitive minds with their questions, and hope the talk helped to ignite interest in accessibility for our future tech talent!

16,"The Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore launched its Innovation Month last week – a series of learning journeys, innovation workshops, hackathons and challenges to imagine and create #HTFuture. It was a privilege to hear presentations from Dr Soon Joo Gog and Bryant Kok at the launch event, and to interact with them during the panel discussion which followed, together with my Senior Director Hooi Boon Phua.
 
Bryant shared how it was important for Gardens by the Bay to create mindshare through its digital products, especially during #covid19, so that it remains a top destination for #Singapore – something never to be taken for granted. Dr Gog shared insights from SkillsFuture SG’s Skills Demand for the Future Economy report, and helpfully contextualised the priority skills that are relevant to support the Home Team’s transformation journey.
 
It was a timely reminder of how organisations that are already at the top of the game have to keep innovating, and to keep learning from others. One message from Dr Gog’s impassioned advocacy that resonated with me – don’t outsource your personal learning to your organisation or your bosses, because transformative assets of skills and experience are your own!
 
Thanks to Shang Yi Chia for the jio – this was fun to do!"
17,"[Hack For Good 2022]

HackForGood 2022 concluded last Saturday and it still feels surreal that we made it as a finalist. For those unaware, Hack For Good is an annual student-run Hackathon by Google Developer Student Clubs NUS (GDSC NUS), that consists of real problem statements from Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) in Singapore. This hackathon serves as a reminder to us all, that technology can, and should, be used for good. As the euphoria of being a finalist subsides in the coming days, I would like to take this opportunity to give special thanks to two of my team members.

Lim Jie Rui joined the Hackathon without any prior experience in HTML/CSS. As a quick learner, he managed to grasp concepts of Web Development (in a day) and contributed a substantial amount to our final demo product, which was made using Bootstrap 5 framework.

On the other hand, Sean Ho consistently went beyond the scope of his delegated task and offered help to me, as I balanced this hackathon with my school work.

And last but not least, a special shout-out to Google Developer Student Clubs NUS (GDSC NUS) for once again hosting another successful event.

Let us all #BePartOfTheGood today!

19,"When skeptics keep calling you a “diversity hire”, so you found more minorities like yourself and inspire even more!

Last Saturday, I volunteered with Malay Muslims iN Tech and Yayasan MENDAKI to share tech career advice!

20 Malay-Muslim professionals from different tech companies shared our experiences and advice on working in tech to over 130 students. Said students came from various backgrounds - madrasahs, JCs, polytechnics, ITE and universities.

In addition to a panel discussion with GOH Rahayu Mahzam and Sharael Taha , we also used VR to launch a hackathon (more details soon!), split into breakout sessions for closer discussions, and even toured the Google Singapore office.

It is an incredibly inspiring event for both students and volunteers. Here’s to more events to get more Malay-Muslim youth into growth sectors!

21,"Over the weekend, I had the pleasure of participating in National University of Singapore's Hack&Roll 2022, one of the largest student-run hackathons in Singapore. Extremely delighted to have clinched the Most Socially Useful Hack award, together with my immensely talented teammates Lyn Tan, Caleb Cheam and Clarissa Bella Jew.

For this hackathon, we developed payMElah, a Telegram bot that takes in a picture of a receipt and splits the bill for you. Ever experienced the headache of splitting complicated bills among friends after a long day out? Well so have we, and our bot aims to take care of that.

We built this using the Telegram bot API coupled with Optical Character Recognition using pyTesseract. Despite the entire team being new to both tools, it was very inspiring and heartwarming to see the team power through the development process and producing a working product in less than 24 hours.

24,"🔻 SPECTRUM OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS 🔻

Had a great time last week at BNP Paribas Singapore where I had a chance to share about employee wellbeing. This was a segment of the EXCITE Hackathon 2022 that was organized by the Design Lab led by Daniel Han and team.

Thanks for the invite!

Great questions facilitated by Robyn Lee as it gave the audience a very good overview of the employee wellbeing space at the moment, for the participants to be able to ideate and tackle the problems empatheticlly.

One of the questions asked was on wellbeing trends, specific to mental health.

Undeniably, this is on the top of every business owners', CEO and HR directors' minds as they try to navigate the increased uncertainty and an ever unfulfilled workforce.

I shared that personally, I feel that mental health needs for organisations can be seen as a spectrum which is already moving into the learning and development (L&D) space as well as the executive coaching space. From dealing with employees who need clinical help, to those that are on the brink of burnout, to those that require coping strategies, to those that are thriving, to those that are consistently peak performing. The mental and psychological aspects of an individual overlap here in more ways than one.

Looking forward to hear what solutions the participants would have come up with through this entire design thinking exercise.

School educators from various Singapore education institutions came together to build applications using Power Apps. The theme revolved around improving student engagement and enhancing collaborative learning, thus cultivating a culture of connectivity in a hybrid learning environment.

There were so many brilliant ideas in the room that day and the ones I particularly liked were those that addressed student wellbeing and encouraged student collaboration especially among the lesser engaged.

Cheers to the Tinkercademy team for this event, I'm glad to have finally met you face-to-face! 😊

Hence, our team conceptualised The Scam-tidote - which aimed to educate the public on cognitive biases as a means of scam prevention.

After two months of hard work, we are thrilled to have emerged as the winners under the sub-category of Forensic Psychology!

A huge thank you to our mentor Parandaman Thechanamurthi for your valuable feedback and guidance, as well as Singapore Psychological Society for hosting this event."
29,"Grateful to be awarded the Most Beautiful Hack 😍 in National University of Singapore's Hack&Roll 2022 last weekend, Singapore's largest student-run hackathon with 700 participants and 250 hacks.

Lawson Teo and I worked on PomoPals, a pomodoro timer for remote teams and groups of friends. The inspiration came from our daily struggles as students. Pre-Covid, we used to study together since we all stayed in hall. However, once we shifted out of hall and with the pandemic ongoing, it wasn't as easy to study together. As students, many of us face the monsters of unproductivity and procrastination, which are all the more harder to fight alone.

Was definitely a great way to end off my uni life with a sleepless night designing and coding 🤠👍🏼 More details can be found under our project's Devpost link below! Thank you organizers and judges!

Hence, we conceptualised The Scam-tidote, which aimed to target cognitive biases as a means of scam prevention.

Thankfully, our efforts paid off and we were awarded with first place in the Forensic Psychology category! This would not have been possible without the guidance of our mentor, Mr. Parandaman, and the hard work of the event organisers from Singapore Psychological Society. Looking forward to more meaningful programmes like Psychathon, where psychology students can collaborate with one another and connect with industry professionals!"
31,"2 years flew by - DORSCON orange first announced during reservist, taking the plunge to properly start my digital skills journey through a full stack bootcamp with Le Wagon Singapore, trying random hackathons on devpost and then stumbling across the better.sg community. It was through better.sg that I met Rohith Srinivas and later Lim Ngee Yong. I will always be thankful for their energy in building and growing the various initiatives (String and TalentGeist) through the days of COVID.

This was the first in-person better.sg community meetup I’ve attended, kindly hosted by the staff from Google. Reconnected with very kind people who supported the digital skills education projects Joanna Lim; met inspiring designers/ entrepreneurs Melvin Lim and Shihui Kong who are also exploring ways to use their tech skills for social good

Two things I really learnt/ appreciated:
1) Energy and community management - as Gaurav Keerthi facilitated the pitches, I could not help but also feel excited for the various project leads whose energy rivals that of startup founder meetups. Good seeing Lloyd Soh again too, always fun to see ex-debaters pitching exciting digital projects :)

2) Systems - looking back at the very first email from better.sg about two years ago, the onboarding process was seamless. Access to Notion, Slack were all associated with a Google account; introductions from Typeform were reposted on Facebook and Slack among other automations. Now there are beginner friendly templates for project management among many other resources. This raised the bar for onboarding and helped me think a lot more about how to improve the #userexperience when joining a new organisation

Thanks Chi Ling Chan Gaurav Keerthi and team - better.sg helped me to meet like-minded people, learn about digital systems/ digital skills education and bring some insights back to both the classroom and various other initiatives

38,"🦄 A week ago marks the successful ending of Solana Labs Summer Camp Hackathon held in Singapore!

👀 As a media skills-first tech skills-second individual, I joined SCHack hoping to meet other brilliant builders, learn more about what they’ve built on Ethereum/Solana, and sharpen my knowledge on technical development. Everyone seemed to share similar goals and excitement, which made for an inclusive environment.

👾 Educational workshops around the Solana ecosystem and code-along sessions were conducted every week. A list of project ideas was also supplemented for anyone needing a spark https://lnkd.in/gi8qymXQ e.g. building DAO frontend on SPL Governance, creating an on-chain carbon market, bringing new-to-crypto users onboard to Web3, and more.

🌈 With my talented group mates, Ying Zhe (George) Loh, Loh Kok Wee, Liam Ayathan, Maaruni Pandithurai and Yun Waddy Soe, we took our time to brainstorm project ideas, with initial ideas tending towards climate-related topics, then slowly moving into NFT ticketing, and finally to physical token-gating. But why stop where TokenProof and MintGate were already doing great in?

In a week, we built a working demo that illustrated how easily event creators can verify NFTs and allow individuals access to a physical space. These NFTs also have the potential to evolve once pre-requisites, set by the creators, are met. With the aim to simplify a manual process event creators go through when verifying NFTs, SolMate supports these creators in delivering a truly Web3-centric event without them having to break their time and money bank to reinvent the tech wheel.

💜 Check out some screenshots from our pitch deck, like/comment/demo avail if interested, and lastly, special shout-out to the awesome organisers at Metacamp (previously OpenHaus) - esp. grateful for their builder-centric community!

It’s been a great learning experience as we gain knowledge and understanding of these topics in our research journey. Appreciative of my awesome Team Panda Warriors - Yan Wen, Ming Yang and Shiting, who have made it possible for us to emerge as the overall winner for the Research (Open) category.

41,"Snap a photo, upload it, share it, and we've got Instagram. A microblog at your finger tips, with likes and comments enabled.

Now take this another step further with snap, upload, share + sell, and we've got Carousell! With one key additional concept, an innovative idea was born, and a marketplace for Singaporeans to clear unwanted items for some money became available.

Two of the co-founders from the National University of Singapore, had joined Singapore’s Startup Weekend hackathon in 2012, and despite having joined it for fun, they received validation for the product on the spot, which gave them the confidence to take the idea further. A landing page was then created, with a few hundred emails collected, and when they had requests for an app download, the founders knew that they had to put together a team and make it a full time venture.

Carousell Group has joined the unicorn club in September 2021, with over 150 million listings and 50 million items sold in 7 countries: Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.

So here are my innovators of the week, Lucas Ngoo, Quek Siu Rui and Marcus Tan. It's certainly great to see successful technopreneurs on our little island, with more to come I hope through inspiring stories like theirs.

44,"This week I participated in my first hackathon, Citi HackOverflow 2022 Singapore. This was a week-long hybrid hackathon which took place from 8-12 August.

Our project revolved around Sustainable Investing and our solution, InvESG, aims to raise awareness about ESG Investing. We calculate a customer’s ESG score from a simple questionnaire and we are able to recommend them companies whose ESG values are in-line with them. Moreover, customers are able to also do another questionnaire which will assess their risk appetite and InvESG will recommend an investment portfolio. We used Python Flask for our backend and used ReactJS for the frontend.

We are pleased to announce that out of 24 teams, we were able to clinch the second position in this hackathon 🙂.

I would like to thank these fellow top lads : Brayden Leo Joel Seah Shun Hui Lee Rohan M.. It has been a great experience working with you guys throughout this hackathon and its heart warming to know that our late-night coding sessions has been fruitful.

53,"“A Journey of a thousand miles, begins with the first step”. In the last two months, my team has had the privilege, opportunity and challenge to in the first Psychology-themed hackathon organised by the Singapore Psychological Society: Psychathon 2022. What started off as an attempt to gain a unique experience in participating in a hackathon soon turned into an interesting journey of developing real-world solutions to improve the lives of Singaporeans in the post-COVID era using the teachings of Counselling Psychology.

The outcome was the cumulation of 2-months of careful planning, innumerable hours of meetings, and uncountable late, late nights of discussion to birth our preventive programme entitled “Project Helix”.
With the current emphasis of enabling mental resilience in mind, Project Helix takes on a preventative, non-pathologizing approach in engaging with Singaporean youths - pulling and integrating novel as well as well-tested practices in the Counselling Psychology world such as peer support groups and Positive Psychology concepts- to imbue in them concepts as well as relevant skills to strengthen their mental resilience, to support their peers as they navigate the uncertainties of a post-COVID world.

We were pleasantly surprised, overwhelmed and ecstatic when our hard work paid off, and our proposal went on to achieve the winning title within the category of Counselling Psychology.

While the results are worth celebrating, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s words ring true: “ its not the destination, it’s the journey”, that bears the greatest value. The last two months, however arduous and demanding, have given us opportunities to gain an even deeper understanding of the field of Counselling Psychology, and how other fields such as Positive Psychology relate and apply in the collective umbrella of Psychological knowledge. I am honoured to work with fellow like-minded individuals who forged a great team as we applied what we’d learnt in our modules into real, world contexts to develop solutions that offer the potential to improve the moments, lives and wellbeing of many.

On this note, I sincerely thank the Singapore Psychological Society for their tireless efforts in hosting this event, as well as our Mentor, Mr Carlin Lee , for sharing his experience, unique perspectives and valuable advice. Most importantly, I am grateful to have met and worked with my teammates, Melissa Chow , Morgan Lim, and Tan Rong Hui, and the experiences and journeys together will never ever be forgotten.
Lastly, I would like to also extend my gratitude to Jeremy Ho, my mentor from the SomethingNew App for his introduction and guidance in the Solution Focused Brief Therapy as it has been one of the key inspirations behind this programme.

I guess the next question is: having taken the first step, how can this Journey be continued, consolidated and completed? 👀

With the Society of Interior Designers Singapore (SIDS) Design Convention 2021 and the SIDAwards 2021 coming to a close last Friday, 2021 is a wrap! 

It was much fun on stage to be the moderator at the SIDS Design Convention 2021. To dialogue with like-minded designers such as Kok Thye Tang, Kelley Cheng and kelly chin (learnt more blockchain and Green Mark!) and see students light up when they hear their names being called for their winning entries.

I always have to remind myself to go slow and enjoy the stage. On stage, I'm like a duck on water. Paddling furiously beneath, but still and calm above the water line.   

I'm sure everyone would agree that the last two years feels a bit of a blank. In these last weeks of 2021, I attempt to pause to BE and not DO. 
 
In hindsight, it's been a fruitful endemic (pandemic?) 2021. After a stint with DesignSingapore Council over the new year, I am back teaching the Year 3s for their Final Year Project and the calling to nurture and help is strong. New curriculum(s) and initiatives to come. I am so thankful for the Singapore Polytechnic DID Teaching Team for their trust and professionalism, proud of our resilient students. They never fail to surprise me, even after teaching for so many years. 

We appointed new Singapore Interior Design Accreditation Council (SIDAC) - Student Chapter Office Bearers in April and this is our most diverse team ever (one per IHL in fact!). I am thankful for the support from all the like-minded tutors from all the IHLs that have come forward to support and lend a supporting hand. With my partner in crime, kelly chin, we wouldn't have been able to pull off a physical student exhibition at SID Fest, a webinar and a design hackathon! You guys rock! 

The Singapore ID Accreditation baby has been born after three years and it's time to let this baby grow. Thank you to Keat Ong 王胜杰 for his perseverance and his trust. I am so thankful for the Taskforce members for their diligence amidst working full time. The SIDS Secretariat's dedication is an inspiration.

SIDS has given me and students much space to play. A mentor, a leader, a team player, a judge, an Honorary Treasurer and Vice-Chair of Singapore Interior Design Accreditation Council (SIDAC). A massive thank you and may the various children of ours grow to its full potential!

Exciting things to come in 2022.
Keep safe and a Merry Christmas and a brilliant New Year to all! 

That's all folks!

61,"I have been called ""monster Mommy"", years ago, by my daughter's Primary school classmates when she was 8 years old. Just because I was a tough mother, who refused to help with homework, and let her get scolded by teachers for forgetting to bring textbooks (I knew of mothers who bought 2 sets of everything, leaving 1 set in school and the other at home, so that their kids never got caught out). It's called building grit and resilience from young, teaching independent responsibility.

But I've also been called ""Jedi-Mama"" by clients who appreciated my tough style of ""parenting"" and educating for Process Engineering exercises (some of them telling me it was one of the hardest things for them to do, because it called for such introspection). I love working with people, and teams too, to guide a thought process or enquiring mindset towards problem solving.

So, it was really fun recently, to go into ""Mommy"" mode again and moderate a panel discussion by our dynamic young Legal Technologists at Rajah & Tann Technologies, for the Singapore Management University Legal Innovation&Technology Hackathon, on what a future in legal technology could look like. Kudos to Low Wei De Ben, Ravleen Khaira, @NoraEmalina for their insightful and entertaining contributions to the conversation.

Process Engineering isn't easy, but it is worth the effort. It's just one of the many solutions and tools out there in the LegalTech landscape that is going to change the future of practice.

Dementia is a significant challenge, especially in an aging demographics like Singapore. It is estimated that we have 100k diagnosed patients. And Dementia is an irreversible and crippling disease.

As always, we want to start with awareness, beginning with our youths, and thus this hackathon event.

We should also learn to identify Dementia patients with ABCD, so that we can render them proper care:
- Activities (inability to perform)
- Behavioural Changes
- Cognitive Decline
- Disorientated

Looking forward to the initiatives proposed by the hackathon teams.

63,"A hackathon noob's experience after taking part in 2 hackathons in 5 months:

During my first hackathon in September 2021, I had no idea how to build a proper website, let alone a fully functional app. Our team pieced together a crude prototype with jquery and bootstrap. We didn't know how to build a proper backend and racked our brains on how to use django together with a javascript front-end (it did not work at all btw).

Fast forward to January, I got a chance to work with some amazing people at Open Government Products, GovTech Singapore to participate in their annual hackathon as a co-hacker. It was a humbling but insightful experience, getting to know how experienced software engineers approach a new project, and I learned so much!

65,"What a Thursday!! Started with an early call to check in on our global Hackathon and the energy across Shanghai, Singapore, Melbourne, Sydney,+ was so inspiring - developing app’s to solve business problems in a day…
Then I met our 71 year old warehouse manager at Yamaha - He is still as active as when he started work at the site more than 40 years ago. When I asked him when he plans to retire and enjoy a more quiet pace, he said “never” - and then he told me that he also runs a rice farm in his home in North Thailand. Age is just a number…
Next was a lunch with the Yamaha leadership team and got a deep insight into their challenges with supply Chain and Covid - and how despite that, we have been able to deliver their motorcycles at more that 97% DIFOT.

And then a visit to our emerging South East Asia 24/7 control room (I call it center of excellence) where we monitor real time what is going on across our transport fleet in countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam : speeding incidents, hard braking, appropriate rest breaks and any emerging problems on their routes. And most exciting, a system built by our local team solving a regional problem.

66,"Happy to share recent success our team have had winning the ""Top of the Quants"" at the Singapore Finale of Bloomberg & CFA Hackathon with our first fully integrated Quantamental Analysis Toolkit

Looking to the Future of Investing

A brief article on the thought process and outline of winning application in the article.

If investment firms looked at themselves like they do their investments, they would spend less time touting past successes and more time explaining how they are evolving to win tomorrow. With this as context, fundamental investors integrating aspects of what quantitative investors do well – and vice versa – is not something to be debated, but something that should be actively explored. After all, it stands to reason that other firms are doing some things better than you. Learning what that is – and how it can be re-purposed for your own needs – is a big part of how any company stays ahead of the competition, investment firms included.

The logic of quantamental investing is simple. Well-trained human analysts can understand how the future may look different than the past - think of changing industry structures, emerging technologies, shifting company positions or new industry regulations. In these situations, machines focused on historical data are at a disadvantage.

On the other hand, well-developed computer models are unmatched in automating tasks, analyzing how the past may predict the future and identifying anomalies (i.e., automation, prediction, detection). No human can match an algorithm’s ability to vet millions of data points in such a manner. Uniquely integrating both presents a logical opportunity.

Success will require more than hiring some people and telling everyone to get to work, however. To be successful, each firm faces a similar but distinct challenge: discover how to best integrate these methods given their unique objectives, skills and experience.

The firms that figure that out are likely to outperform.

It was purely exhilarating to see our plans coming live on a bright and beautiful Saturday morning - our first inaugural hackathon organized by Girls in Tech (Cross-Polytechnic) Singapore, NCS Group, and vLookUp.

This hackathon was seeded with the motivation to further expose our young to how a tech career goes beyond the roles of a programmer or engineer.

Huge thanks to Lance Foo, Wynthia Goh, Kanchana Gupta, Lea-Eng Cheong, Cherie Kiew, Valerie Ong, Evelyn Yeo, and Victoria Teo Wei Xuan.

To the girls, don’t let this opportunity go! I wished I could join and be in for an experiential journey to NCS’s Innovation Centre in Melbourne or Shenzen too!"
68,"Before I spoke at the Climate Change and Sustainability Hackathon event yesterday, (by the UK Singapore Universities Alliance for Entrepreneurship and Innovation or UKSAEI), I used to think that #sustainability is nothing but a scorecard objective for corporations: do some CSR, donate to some cause, and you have proven yourself as a sustainable brand.

With recent experiences building up #startups and innovation ideas as Wildcats.io, I discovered that Sustainability is becoming integral to the missions of the next wave of business #innovation, and no longer a 'side dish' to the main course of business.

I shared the journeys of KIM Chanamrithvatey and Vong Oudom building a Circular Recycling business in #Cambodia, Anjelo Alonte's passion for content and wholesome foods, and the winning ideas from Wildcats.io's recent #MySummerStartup challenge, which surprisingly all revolved around waste reduction, reduce/reuse economy!

And my conclusion after the sharing and discussions? Sustainability as a Business Goal can be a true #differentiator for a business in ANY industry, if the founders genuinely believe that their actions will eventually make them Desirable, Feasible, and Viable.

All the best to the teams in the Hackathon! May you find a topic you're passionate about, and a problem that can be solved with sustainability in mind!

Thanks Michael Yap for the opportunity to share :)"

Over the past week, my team and I (Maaruni Pandithurai, Yun Waddy Soe) participated in Singapore Blockchain Innovation Challenge 2021, organised by Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme, and emerged 3rd!

The theme for the hackathon was cross-chain interoperability with a strong focus on user experience. Our team built a simple NFT marketplace for the rental and listing of bicycles. Each bicycle is represented as an NFT on an L2 bicycle chain. On top of corporations, individuals with bicycles sitting around can list their bicycles on the chain, earning them extra income and giving power back to the people! Users can then rent bicycles by connecting their Ethereum (L1) wallet to the marketplace! This not only removes the hassle of downloading specific applications for rental, but with direct linking to their Ethereum wallet and the immutability of records on the blockchain, it can enforce stronger accountability on riders, leading to a more sustainable bike-sharing/rental community.

This hackathon gave us a deeper appreciation of blockchain technology and its applications, from relay chains and Polkadot bridges to writing smart contracts using solidity. This has been a great launchpad for us in our DeFi journey.

We would like to thank our mentors, Jason Liew 🚀 from Bybit and Kunpeng Ren from National University of Singapore, for the insights and thought-provoking questions during our mentor session! 

We would also like to thank Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme for organising the hackathon and providing us with this platform to learn and grow!

71,"I am honoured to announce that this summer (24/7/22 – 28/8/22), along with my outstanding team SEAT members (Shenyi Cui Emmanuel Ang Terence Poh), placed 1st amongst 110 other teams across the world in the Singapore Airlines AppChallenge 2022 (Tertiary Track).

Our project used TensorFlow Recommenders A.I., which considers user-profiles and preferences to recommend activities, accommodations and other ancillary services to users post flight booking. We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).

As a U.I. designer and developer on the team, I experimented with new workflows, such as focusing on producing a feasible design early on before handing it over for development. The new workflow significantly reduces the time needed to develop the minimal viable product (MVP). Aside from that, I designed and deployed a Flask application to process the data and serve as an API to handle communication between TensorFlow Recommenders and our front-facing web application.

It was an arduous yet fulfilling journey for my team and I. We worked many late nights, juggling school and the project, hoping to produce our best work. I managed to learn from my teammates and other finalists. I am thrilled to have participated and given my all. If given the opportunity, my team and I look forward to furthering the development of the product.

72,"I am honoured to announce that, along with my excellent team SEAT members (Emmanuel Ang, Aaron K., Terence Poh), I placed 1st amongst 110 other teams across the world in the Singapore Airlines AppChallenge 2022 (Tertiary Track).

Our project used TensorFlow Recommenders A.I., which considers user profiles and preferences to recommend activities, accommodations and other ancillary services to users post flight booking. We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).

As one of the Product Developers, my role was to translate the business idea into a viable prototype as a proof of concept. Referencing the excellent Figma design created by Aaron K., I coded out the logic and workflow of the application with React and Ionic. It was tough to juggle both this project and the demands of the university; however, the end product was worth the hardship and arduous sleepless nights. 

I managed to learn a lot throughout this hackathon, both from my teammates and other fellow Student finalists. Given the opportunity, the team and I are looking forward to the further development of the product.

We would like to thank the Singapore Airlines Group and NUS Enterprise for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Greg Blackwood for increasing the team's potential through his outstanding mentorship and guidance during the last two weeks of the hackathon."
73,"It has been a week since the conclusion of HackFest 2022 at Google Singapore, yet, I am still not over the 13 days of innovative projects, great people, and insightful technical sessions. 

HackFest 2022 was a 13-day Hackathon where students from tertiary institutions across Singapore presented their innovative and intriguing 'hacks' on the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

The event was a great success, and it was an incredible experience collaborating with Daniel Low from Google Developer Student Club PSB Academy (GDSC PSBA) and his core team. The resilience, resolve, and passion demonstrated by the core team members from NTU and PSB Academy enabled us to host HackFest with tremendous success.

HackFest would have been incomplete without our guest speakers and judges Julius Uy, Weiyuan Liu, Saurabh Arora, Thye Yeow Bok, Hassan A., Hairizuan Noorazman, Jirawat Karanwittayakarn, Richard Lee, Joshua de Guzman, Shang Yi Lim and Yong Shean Chong. Thank you all for your time, efforts, and valuable insights! 

Colossal thanks to 💻 Rachel Sau Han L. and Janise Tan • 陈美璇 for being the pillars of the event and giving Daniel and I the support and guidance to host a successful event!

74,"In SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022, my TEAM TAGAR won 2nd Place.

I took advantage of my summer break to participate in my first hackathon - SCDF and Dell's Innovation Lifesavers' Innovation Challenge 2022 - with my TAGAR teammates: Terence Poh Aaron K. Godwinn W. Rachel Ow Yeong

Our project aims to help reduce SCDF Paramedics' cognitive workload by pulling vital information from existing government sources and dispatcher call logs, tagging them with a neural network, and presenting it in an easy-to-read and accessible way. Through our application, we also made case-specific Just-in-Time revisions easily accessible.

Having served national service as a Medic, my team and I understood the benefits of ground-up solutions and paid particular attention to the processes of the paramedics during our ideation. By improving the processes, we then aimed to increase their germane load without changing the way they think or act.

The experience of working with cloud computing technologies and machine learning was brand-new to me. Designing and developing a cloud-native minimum viable product (MVP) in less than 4 days inclusive of containerisation and pushing to Dell's VMware was a challenge. Furthermore, I learned a lot about machine learning concepts related to text classification specifically bags of word models.

Through this experience, I gained essential developer skills such as Flask, Dockers, and Tanzu App. Though I am only scratching the surface of what I can do with my development skills, I am happy to announce that I have found my passion and interest in being a developer. The fact that I participated and gave it my best is extremely rewarding to me.

Special Thanks
Thanks to Dell Technologies and Singapore Civil Defence Force for organising this hackathon. Special shoutout to Eugene Swee and his fellow Dell mentors for their patience and guidance throughout the hackathon. #innovation #cloud #hackathon"

78,"The Ministry of Home Affairs Singapore launched its Innovation Month last week – a series of learning journeys, innovation workshops, hackathons and challenges to imagine and create #HTFuture. It was a privilege to hear presentations from Dr Soon Joo Gog and Bryant Kok at the launch event, and to interact with them during the panel discussion which followed, together with my Senior Director Hooi Boon Phua.
 
Bryant shared how it was important for Gardens by the Bay to create mindshare through its digital products, especially during #covid19, so that it remains a top destination for #Singapore – something never to be taken for granted. Dr Gog shared insights from SkillsFuture SG’s Skills Demand for the Future Economy report, and helpfully contextualised the priority skills that are relevant to support the Home Team’s transformation journey.
 
It was a timely reminder of how organisations that are already at the top of the game have to keep innovating, and to keep learning from others. One message from Dr Gog’s impassioned advocacy that resonated with me – don’t outsource your personal learning to your organisation or your bosses, because transformative assets of skills and experience are your own!
 
Thanks to Shang Yi Chia for the jio – this was fun to do!"

The question posed to us was ""How can we apply psychology to improve the lives of Singaporeans in a post-COVID world?”. My team chose to tackle this problem in the field of Educational Psychology. As university students, this topic is close to our hearts. COVID-19 has demanded big changes to education, and we wanted to find a way to wrestle back control from the pandemic's jaws and shape the future education.

I would like to thank our mentor Ms Faridah Ali Chang for her support and belief in both the team, and the idea we had. She encouraged us to dream big and envision our idea as a real solution to the challenges in Educational Psychology today. We truly couldn't have done this without her support!

Thank you to my friends and team members - Dylan Ong, Joan Ng, Wong Joon Mien and Chloe Lee. Each one of us brought a unique ingredient to the table and through our shared resolve, we made it here. I wouldn't be here without any of you! Lastly, thank you to the organising committee for the work put into this event!"

85,"After an intensive and fulfilling 6-mths, I’ve finally graduated from the Digital Transformation & Change Management course (with Distinction) under the RISE programme by DigitalBCG Academy.

Digital transformation is not just about technology and there remains a misconception that it is just about digitisation. It entails more than that…much much more. It involves the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, changing the way you operate, changing the way you work with partners, and changing the way value is delivered to customers. It's also entails a mindset and cultural change within the organization.

A big shout out to RISE by DigitalBCG Academy and the wonderful trainers/advisors (Sagar Goel, Mukund Rajagopalan, Rithesh Shetty, Sudheer Marisetti, Ying PANG, Cédric DUFOUR - IT Strategy, Sandeep Shouche, Miranda Adams and many more) for putting together this wonderful programme to equip us with the right digital, data and agile skills needed to stay relevant in the evolving digital landscape that we live in. Special thanks too to our TA, Mariko Kita Osada, for being our Aunt Agony when we faced issues and ensuring our learning journey went smoothly.

To the Hackathon and Capstone project partner companies, Olam and Singapore Airlines, it was a pleasure working on the projects you had handed to our cohort.

I’ve enjoyed this learning journey tremendously and I’m grateful to my course mates, especially my “G9” kakis - Anglia A., Dawn Windschuttle-Tan, Maricelle Wong, Chin Ping Tan, Sze Lynn Wong, MBA, Gim Leng, HOW for accompanying me on this journey. You are an awesome bunch to work with. I’ve learnt a lot from you all and I truly value the friendships that have been forged.

101,"Southeast Asian technology companies have a strong track record of hiring women— better than tech companies in US, Britain and Australia. Yet the region has further to go to reach true parity in the number of women who work in tech compared with other industries.

According to a STEM Gender gap report by Nanyang Technological University Singapore Females make up only 21 per cent of Singapore’s engineering graduates and 28 per cent of information technology graduates.

“Hackathon” style workshops are gaining momentum in this market as it gives younger generations an opportunity to think laterally about solving real world problems and it’s encouraging to see J.P. Morgan inspiring the next generation of female leaders within technology industries.

I have had the pleasure of working with non-profit WISE - WASH in Southeast Asia who are also advocates of this type of learning to help create sustainable behaviour change through technology.

It is not only technology industries where a lack of female leaders highlights a missed opportunity. Consider that across all industries, women make up more than 50% of university graduates but fewer than 15% of CEO and board-level positions in Southeast Asia. This is a problem worldwide, and in all industries, due to an array of deep-rooted issues.

According to a BCG paper from 2020, “companies where women account for more than 20% of the management team have approximately 10% higher innovation revenues than companies with male-dominated leadership.”

There is a common misconception that male counterparts within technology industries have greater competencies, which in turn has an impact on the number of female leaders and therefore role models, especially within Asia.

The more we hear about these types of initiatives the better, as it highlights the stories of those role models that are inspiring and making strides in this industry. Yoke Pean Thye

103,"It was my pleasure to be invited to represent Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) to judge at MindfulHacks 2022, a student-led mental health hackathon. The event concluded yesterday at NVPC - Towards a City of Good.

The top teams were:
1st: PotatoFarmer - an app for journalling as a way to increase client and therapist engagement, with sentiment analysis capabilities to alert the therapists to possibilities of high risk cases
2nd: Pawsitive - a game to educate students on Psychological First Aid
3rd: Counsella - an AR counsellor whom one can talk to in between scheduled counselling sessions

I had fun judging and looking through the interesting ideas and prototypes that the students came up with (there was even a Tinder-like app for healthcare providers to seek mental health support). Glad I got to put my training in psychology to good use after so many years. Most importantly, I hope the students do not stop working on the ideas after the competition and that one day we can see some of them become entrepreneurs in the service of society.

Special thanks to Timothy Liau and Rachel Tan for inviting me, and fellow judges Derek Joseph Sun, Hanh B., Wang Wei and Andy T..

Corporate Innovation 5: Incubators & Accelerators 孵化和加速

Hackathons help us to generate new ideas and proof-of-concept. How to continue from there?

Increasinlgy, organisations create Innovation Centres to bring these new ideas to life. There are more than 50 corporate innovation centres in Singapore (finanical institutions, consumers, industrial...)!

What do these Innovation Centres do?
- Hackathons: generate solutions to challenging problems
- Incubations: generate proof of concept on commerical use
- Accelerations: generate proof of values (and revenue) on commercial roll-out

105,"Solana Summer Camp is an online hackathon where builders turn ideas into the next big Web3 project. The Singapore edition was hosted by SolanaFM and Metacamp (previously OpenHaus).

I had the privilege of attending various seminars throughout the month long event, where I’ve learnt so much and even met some really awesome builders! The next big thing is definitely out there, and events like Solana Summer Camp can provide the right guidance and resources for these growing projects. ⚒️

Huge thanks to Fathur Rahman for the invite and giving me the opportunity to learn more, and special thanks to Jonas Chen for the amazing hospitality! It was an amazing event! 🥳"

107,"I am extremely grateful to have emerged as finalists of NTU IdeasJam 2022 by Garage@EEE. Over the course of the hackathon, we explored Green Technology solutions and environmental sustainability, in accordance with the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Along with my amazing teammates from ChangeX, Vinay Krishnaa, Aditya Selvam, Phumrapee Pisutsin and Ye Xin, we developed a technical solution to tackle the issue of increasing carbon emissions.

It was an honour to generate ideas for a modern problem as paramount as this and pitch our prototype to a panel of industry professionals. Special thanks to our mentors Janani Chandran and Jamil Khan for their invaluable input and industry insights as you really inspired us to take our product to the next level. A massive shoutout to our previous mentors from Versent, Thomas F., Han Ken Fong and Ough Chee Keong, whose advice was key in helping us to get the ball rolling. 

Overall, this has been a wonderful opportunity and I am excited for what the future holds for us."
108,"I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as a Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs after completing a Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering with Honors (Highest Distinction), along with a Minor in Business at Nanyang Technological University Singapore !

112,"Last weekend, I took a small leap of courage to pitch Lovespan to National Youth Council Singapore.

It was my first time ever pitching an idea for funding $$$. Before that, I’ve only ever pitched to hackathon judges 😂. It was a new experience and honestly, a little out of my comfort zone.

Days leading up to the pitch, I prepared my deck and practiced my presentation. I asked samantha see to watch me present. I even picked out a shirt that complemented my pitch deck colour palette.

I felt a little nervous as I joined the Zoom meeting for the pitch. But that feeling quickly went away thanks to the warmth and friendliness of the YoungChangeMaker curators (the people I was pitching to).

It's clear that their goal is not to criticise ideas, but rather, understand them and figure out how to help them succeed. The diverse backgrounds of the curators also helped me gain new perspectives on my project. Especially so during the Q&A session, where I was asked questions I never even thought about!

Shoutout to Nicolette Tan and the other curators for the feedback and resources shared. It was also really cool to discover other projects like Underground Cartoons (an animation festival!) and Inter-University Environmental Coalition (IUEC).

It’s now been a week since the pitch. I’m delighted to share Lovespan was approved for the YoungChangeMakers grant 🎉 There’s still a lot of uncertainty, and a bunch of assumptions to be validated. But I’m excited to see where this project goes!"

115,"Last week, I took part in my first ever hackathon, the SMU Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Hackathon 2022 together with Zhiyi Hao, Eugene Yan, Douglas Toh, Chen Tianyu and Yeo Zhi Wei. As a result of the collective effort of all my group members, we emerged as Top 8 Finalists and was awarded the Norton Rose Fulbright The Big Leap Forward Award!

The problem statement we picked was 'How can different data processing regulations across the region be compared efficiently and effectively?' under the theme of Data Privacy and Cybersecurity.

Our solution allows users to compare the different data privacy regulations across different countries. At the same time, we integrated an AI Chatbot which allows users to ask questions and be given answers. We spent about 2 weeks coming up with ideas and eventually creating a React web application. You can check it out here: https://lnkd.in/dV2e5Cc4

A big thank you to the organisers, sponsors, industry experts and fellow participants for an enjoyable and insightful hackathon. I am looking forward to more hackathons and also having more hands-on experience in the digitalisation of the legal industry in Singapore.

116,"As the summer break draws to a close, I want to take the chance to reflect on what has been a rewarding and exciting three months:

In May, my teammates (Michael, Justin, Khair, Timothy) and I were stoked to have won the Goldman Sachs Engineering Engage (GS ENGage) Hackathon in the Customizable Report Rendering category. Thank you to Goldman Sachs Engineering Singapore for this great opportunity and all the helpful feedback!

Furthermore, after 12 weeks, Tuesday marked the end of my internship at Fisher & Paykel Appliances. It has been enlightening working at FPA and I am grateful for having had this wonderful learning experience.

I'd like to express my gratitude to my team and colleagues as the work I have done would not have been possible without all your support and guidance. It has been a great pleasure to meet and work alongside so many amazing people!

12 weeks has flown by too quickly, however, all good things must come to an end. I am incredibly excited for the coming semester and what lays for me ahead!"
117,"After attending a gruelling 4 day hackathon with my amazing team mates Peh Wee Din (Nathan) Jie Sheng Chong Sze Kee Tew @tan hui xian gave it our best and emerged as semi-finalist in the recent Deep Learning Week hosted within Nanyang Technological University Singapore.

Our solution focused on using Machine Learning models to help deter and prevent phishing attacks from malicious URLs and QR codes AKA ""Quishing"". This issue is getting more prevalent as Singaporeans in general have placed blind faith in scanning QR codes and clicking on links to help facilitate SafeEntry access to malls. As a result, there has been a 94% increase in Phishing and Quishing attacks in the first half of 2022 as compared to the previous year.

As a junior developer, this hackathon has taught me valuable lessons in developing and deploying ML models with different members and how large organisations handle the task of training and developing models across different teams. I've also learnt that the best learning for programming comes from outside the class room where you get to work on real data and industry-related deployment projects.

This experience has been an eye-opening one for me and I've definitely realised that I've a long way to go and to always be at the forefront of emerging tech stacks and new technologies."
118,"To promote Singapore and the region's cybersecurity tools and development culture, Division Zero (Div0) launched our flagship hackathon — HackSmith — in 2017.

119,"Early this week, I was granted an opportunity to participate in Citi HackOverflow 2022. This week-long hackathon was conducted virtually for four days and ended with an exciting physical event.

I am pleased to announce that out of the 24 teams that participated in the hackathon; our team achieved 2nd place in the competition.

Our team’s application, InvESG, aims to promote sustainable investing to new and mass affluent investors. This application would seek to understand a client’s inclination toward the three aspects of the ESG (Environmental, social, and corporate governance) framework and recommend listed companies that align with the client’s values.

Many thanks to my teammates for all the late-night discussions and acting as each other’s rubber ducky.

121,"Despite Code For Cities Hackathon 2022 having ended 2 weeks ago, the experience has been unforgettable. As a student taking Smart-City Management and Technology major, this hackathon was an amazing opportunity for me to gain more insights and expose myself to the problems faced within Smart Cities.

The theme for the Code For Cities this year is “Quantum Computing in Smart Cities”, focusing on how quantum computing can be used to solve problems faced in the various aspects of a Smart City. Our team decided to focus on Singapore's mobility aspect. We created an algorithm that involves Quantum Annealing to improve on Singapore’s Green Light Determining System to improve Time Efficiency when travelling, and eliminate social consequences like Air and Noise Pollution.

“Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”

Despite the steep learning curve as none of us had any prior knowledge about Quantum Computing, I am proud to share that my team, Five Guys, managed to get 1st place out of 28 teams.

I am thrilled that I managed to share my first Hackathon experience with my good friends - Alison How | Joel Tan | Keith Law | De Han Chia. A big thank you SMU Smart City Society, IBM, IMDA, Centre for Quantum Technologies for organizing Code For Cities Hackathon 2022.

This learning opportunity has fueled my burning passion to continue striving for the endless opportunities within and for a Smart City like Singapore. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for all of us!"
