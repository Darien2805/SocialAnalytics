We aimed to leverage our A.I. recommendation system to create a stickier ecosystem and ultimately increase the revenue streams to the Singapore Airlines Group. Our solution was served directly to the users with a friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA).    As a Business Analyst, my deep dive into the aviation and tourism industry was an exciting opportunity to garner new insights. In such a competitive landscape, identifying key challenges and assessing viable pipelines led to developing a robust strategy that complemented the team's direction and solution. Throughout the process, we continuously reevaluated our approach which eventually took shape as we considered realistic and essential aspects to ensure the success of our project.    It was an arduous yet enriching journey for the team. We worked many late nights, juggling the new school term while handling the project - all towards the goal of producing our best work. I am incredibly fortunate to learn a lot from my teammates and other finalists. If given the opportunity, the team and I are looking forward in furthering the development of the product.
