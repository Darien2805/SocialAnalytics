"During this semester break, I participated in Shopee Code League 2022 with my teammates Goh Aik Leong and Kim Junghan.    This year's Code League participants were asked to solve challenging algorithmic puzzles developed by the Shopee Engineering Team. From the knowledge I learnt in my Year 1's module Data Structure and Algorithm(DSAG), I have decided to give it a go! Despite not winning any prizes, my first experience participating in a coding competition was extremely educational for me, as I got to gain insight into how coding can be used in real-life applications.    Thank you Shopee for hosting Code League and for providing this learning opportunity.",To Infinity and Beyond
