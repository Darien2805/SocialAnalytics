Sometimes you gotta fight for something you deserve.Hello, Connections.I hope you are doing well. Last year, I won the Global Coding Challenge organized by Credit Suisse from the rest of the world region, and this year I landed in the second position. It wasn’t easy for me because I was disqualified, as my solution for problem 4 matched with someone else’s. I have posted my solution as well here.Finally, I would like to congratulate my friend Bibek Panthi and am glad to share that the top two positions are from Tribhuvan University. Congratulations to us!!!#coding #university"

3,"Good morning, hope y'all had a great long weekend! Over the last couple of days #Debitsuisse #creditsuisse Credit Suisse arose. The remarks and attempts to calm the market resemble a story being told in 2008. This story ended with circuit breaking a so called ""free market"" because of counterparty risks.Don't you ever ask yourself why banks get bailed out? Because a central authority can make an exception of their own rules while you cannot. You are being told a story of equality while you are not able to print yourself out of a little financial problem.The foundation of our economical everyday transactions is based on debts. What's that gotta do with you?Well, back in 2015 Greece limited withdrawals from bank accounts to 50€/ day because of counterparty risks. In 2021 Canada froze bank accounts based on a political agenda. You are only one state emergency away to loose access to your hard-earned money. What all the above basically means is, they can steal from you, they can control you, they can manipulate you.On the other side of the isle there is a powerful alternative based on roughly 30.000 lines of code. This technology is so paramountly arrogant that all of its code is open source. Everyone in the world can study it. Challenge it. Debug it. But no single entity can change the rules. Confiscate your money. Discriminate against you. The beauty of #bitcoin is its simplicity: Rule without rulers. One of the most staggering labels you can put on it is:Bitcoin is for enemies. Because it is safe. For you. For Them. For everybody. It's your iron dome against invasive governments and it doesn't need to fire a single rocket. Bitcoin is peace. And all you got is co2 emissions to talk me out of it. Come back, when you really thought that through!Deutsche Bank Markus Büch Daniel Stelter Matt Auchtung Rene Gruner Andrew Axelrod Alexander Stahel #money #technology #bank #canada"
