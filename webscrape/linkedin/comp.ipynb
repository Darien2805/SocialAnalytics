So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

       " {'Post Text': 'I sustained an injury last month that will likely put me out of competition for the whole year, lol. So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system. It’s a nice change from the day to day policy and administrative work.\\n…see more',\n",

Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how?

       " {'Post Text': 'I sustained an injury last month that will likely put me out of competition for the whole year, lol. So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities. Hence I still spend a little bit of time at the ED to stay in touch with Emergency Medicine and the EMS system.

       " 'I sustained an injury last month that will likely put me out of competition for the whole year, lol. So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",

       " 'I sustained an injury last month that will likely put me out of competition for the whole year, lol. So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha.

       " 'I sustained an injury last month that will likely put me out of competition for the whole year, lol. So I have repurposed my skateboards for rehabilitation.Recovery requires setting goals and making progress towards them. Recovery is not about getting back the past, but moving forward into the future. Say, the goal is to walk. So you break down the things you need to do in order to walk. For example, you need to alternatively put all your weight on one leg, balance on it, lift up your other leg, and swing it forward. And so you practice those things in part, then in whole. Sometimes you have to make things harder to make things easier. In the video, I’m trying to retrain my body to balance on my affected left leg while walking. The action is similar to walking. But the skateboard is unstable, and swinging the other leg makes it even more unstable. So everything has to work harder. Under normal circumstances, balance would hopefully be not so challenging, and that’s the point. But because it’s challenging I expect to fail often, lol. That’s why the wall is there, haha. Recovery requires effort, and effort requires hope. But sometimes things may seems hopeless. Progress gives hope but nothing seems to happening! So how? Small or big, a step forward is a step forward. If a even a small step seems hopeless, break it down to even smaller steps.About 4 weeks ago, I couldn’t even control my foot, much less my leg. So balancing on two legs was not possible, what more on one leg, lol. So, I need smaller milestones. I spend a few hours a day for a few days, “exercising” my motionless foot, instructing it to lift like the other foot. “See what your bro is doing! Follow! Like you are trying to flip a skateboard, haha!” A few days I felt my toes twitching, but couldn’t see anything. Then my toes lifted slightly. A few days the whole foot lifted off the floor. So, be kind to yourself! Don’t wait for hope! Make hope!  A step forward is a step forward, no matter how big or small. What’s your experience?P.S. Please don’t try this at home or anywhere for that matter, haha. Ok, seriously, don’t. The stuff you see me doing in this video was definitely not recommended by my doctors or therapists.Reflections on #bekindtoyourself #recovery #hope\\n…see more',\n",
       " 'Spent 2 days in Penang for the EMS skills competition during monsoon season to judge 72 first responder and paramedic teams competing in the wilderness. This was followed by 2 days at the College of Emergency Medicine Malaysia conference to give a lecture on resuscitation and judge a scientific poster session. Finally it’s off to UiTM campus where the EMS medical director workshop was held to talk about ambulance safety and share at a roundtable session on international EM with Ali Haedar  Sattha Riyapan & Faith Joan Gaerlan. Why do I still go trudging through the mud and see what goes on at the frontlines? It’s very easy to get too comfortable behind a desk and get disconnected to the ground realities.
