"Good morning, hope y'all had a great long weekend! Over the last couple of days #Debitsuisse #creditsuisse Credit Suisse arose. The remarks and attempts to calm the market resemble a story being told in 2008. This story ended with circuit breaking a so called ""free market"" because of counterparty risks.  Don't you ever ask yourself why banks get bailed out? Because a central authority can make an exception of their own rules while you cannot. You are being told a story of equality while you are not able to print yourself out of a little financial problem.    The foundation of our economical everyday transactions is based on debts. What's that gotta do with you?  Well, back in 2015 Greece limited withdrawals from bank accounts to 50€/ day because of counterparty risks. In 2021 Canada froze bank accounts based on a political agenda. You are only one state emergency away to loose access to your hard-earned money. What all the above basically means is, they can steal from you, they can control you, they can manipulate you.    On the other side of the isle there is a powerful alternative based on roughly 30.000 lines of code. This technology is so paramountly arrogant that all of its code is open source. Everyone in the world can study it. Challenge it. Debug it.  But no single entity can change the rules. Confiscate your money. Discriminate against you. The beauty of is its simplicity: Rule without rulers. One of the most staggering labels you can put on it is:  Bitcoin is for enemies. Because it is safe. For you. For Them. For everybody. It's your iron dome against invasive governments and it doesn't need to fire a single rocket. Bitcoin is peace. And all you got is co2 emissions to talk me out of it. Come back, when you really thought that through!",At no time in history have the people forcing others into compliance been the good guys.

Thiel has always used contrarianism as part of his playbook to gain mainstream acceptance from his student Libertarian days to his Paypal/ tech hedge fund days to his right wing politics.

"#SuisseSecrets... a storm in a teacup, in my professional opinion. TLDR:  1) Not the stuff of a future James Bond movie, nor of a future Netflix series, for that matter.  2) FinCrime expertise gaps in the newspaper articles on are clearly visible to experts only (not to laymen), leading to incorrect reporting, conclusions and a lack of informed assessment.  3) The data leak has already -and rightfully so, in my opinion- disappeared from the news papers. Viewed in the correct perspective, its relevance and significance is rather low.    ... link to the full article, below:","PMP-certified Project Manager | Financial Crime Compliance | Remediations, Investigations & Regulatory Response | Certified Fraud Examiner"

"Are you a student, new to LinkedIn and getting ignored when asking for referrals, help, advice in messages, then this one is for you.    When I was in college I made tons of mistakes while networking and asking for referrals, help and advice over LinkedIn. After I posted that I had received an off-campus placement at Credit Suisse and during the month of Global Coding Challenge, a lot of students reached out to me asking help in various things related to interviews and specifically for Credit Suisse. This is an attempt to make sure at-least the basic behind networking is clear.    If this helped you like, comment and share so this reaches out to as many students as possible and also this increases your activity on LinkedIn, eventually letting people know you are eager to network and learn.",Software Development Engineer @Amazon
